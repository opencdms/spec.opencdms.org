<p>In essence, a WFS could provide vector and tabular climate data, which could be presented in a number of formats such as GML (see OGC GML web page) or Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) shapefile.</p>
<p>Some WFS implementations can serve data constrained by a logical data model (also known as an application schema). It may also be possible to enable WFS server software to provide meteorological observation data via WMO formats such as BUFR.</p>
<p>There may be issues with serving time series via WFS. There is discussion that a Sensor Web Service may be better for time-series
observations.</p>

<p>There are a number of services that will become available when work stabilizes on these standards. Sensor Web Services are typically used with data that conform to the observations and measurements data model. This model is well suited to time-series data. Therefore, Sensor Web Services may be an appropriate mechanism for serving time-series climate data in the future.</p>

                <td class="cdms-content">
                    <p>This component concerns a series of technological tools that enable a data publisher to distribute a data product in an environment that supports managed change to the source data.</p>
<p>In theory, end-users could subscribe to a data source and have changes to the data replicated in their copy of the data.</p>
<p>In summary, geosynchronization services are expected to support several processes, including:
1. Allowing interested parties to subscribe to an authoritative data source.
2. Data entry with validation.
3. Notifying interested parties of changes.
4. Allowing replication of the data provider’s features.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that geosynchronization services will support crowdsourced data and processes in addition to authoritative data sources.</p>
<p>At present, geosynchronization services are being developed with the current version of a standard that only serves data via a WFS. </p>
<p>It is expected that geosynchronization will support additional services in the future, including WCS and WMS.</p>

a) OGC overview of geosynchronization services
b) The OWS 7 engineering report on the test of geosynchronization services</p>

                    <p>This component covers a range of technological instruments that provide a standards-based framework for developing spatial processing services that operate via an internal network or the Internet.</p>
<p>This standard is being used by a number of open-source projects and vendors to develop the building blocks that will support a wide range of spatial analytic processes.</p>
<p>The latest version of the standard is being developed to support both synchronous and asynchronous Web Processing Services (WPS).</p>
<p>This standard has considerable potential for future CDMS use, for example:
1. To enable an NMHS to establish a suite of services to process and analyse climate data within a services-oriented architecture.
2. To enable a future service-provider to offer CDMS-related services via “the cloud”.</p>
