It may also be possible to enable WFS server software to provide meteorological observation data via WMO formats such as BUFR.\n\nThere may be issues with serving time series via WFS. There is discussion that a Sensor Web Service may be better for time-series\nobservations.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) OGC WFS documentation",

Therefore, Sensor Web Services may be an appropriate mechanism for serving time-series climate data in the future.\n\nFor more information, see the OGC documentation for:\na) Observations and measurements\nb) Sensor Observation Services",

Allowing interested parties to subscribe to an authoritative data source.\n2. Data entry with validation.\n3. Notifying interested parties of changes.\n4. Allowing replication of the data provider\u2019s features.\n\nIt is anticipated that geosynchronization services will support crowdsourced data and processes in addition to authoritative data sources.\n\nAt present, geosynchronization services are being developed with the current version of a standard that only serves data via a WFS. \n\nIt is expected that geosynchronization will support additional services in the future, including WCS and WMS.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) OGC overview of geosynchronization services\nb) The OWS 7 engineering report on the test of geosynchronization services",

To enable an NMHS to establish a suite of services to process and analyse climate data within a services-oriented architecture.\n2. To enable a future service-provider to offer CDMS-related services via \u201cthe cloud\u201d.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) WPS Wikipedia entry\nb) OGC WPS documentation",
