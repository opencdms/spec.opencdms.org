An extract is reproduced below.\nIt is not standard practice in climate science to publish the raw data and the computer code\nin academic papers. However, climate science is a matter of great importance and the quality\nof the science should be irreproachable. We therefore consider that climate scientists should\ntake steps to make available all the data that support their work (including raw data) and full\nmethodological workings (including the computer codes).\nThis has implications for the effective management of climate data and software in that software\nsource code will also require careful management.\nIn addition, it will be necessary to keep track of the time period during which each software\nversion is in operation, as this may also have implications for climate data and climate analysis.\nOn a conceptual level, this is similar in a way to the need to have effective observations metadata\nthat describe the maintenance of sensors and stations.",
