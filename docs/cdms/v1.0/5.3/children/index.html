1. Observations data showing daily precipitation at a station
2. Radar data covering the station
3. Synoptic forecast charts
4. Satellite imagery</p>

                <td class="cdms-content">
                    <p>This component refers to a set of tests that rely on experience and knowledge of observation processes, techniques and instrumentation to detect inconsistent, unlikely or impossible records and flag them as suspect. A manual investigation may then assess the validity of the suspect values.</p>
<p>Some examples are problems typically caused by:
1. Inexperienced operators.
2. Instruments that are not or are incorrectly calibrated.
3. Operator behaviour or organizational policy, for example not recording rainfall data over a weekend period and aggregating the results on the following Monday.
4. Known deficiencies in observers handling data such as evaporation-related observations.
5. Changes over time caused by changes at an observation site. For example, a shift in the magnitude of wind recorded from a specific direction may be an indicator of a problem at the site location, such as a new building structure or trees obstructing the flow of the wind in that direction.</p>

                <td class="cdms-content">
                    <p>This component covers a number of tests that statistically analyse historical data to detect inconsistent, unlikely or impossible records and flag them as suspect. A manual investigation may then assess the validity of the suspect values.</p>
<p>Some examples are:
1. Climate tests that highlight extreme climatic values, such as a record maximum air temperature.
2. Flatline tests where a constant value exceeds the specified limit in a time series, for example when the station air temperature remains constant for 12 hours.
3. Spike tests conducted in a time series to identify data spikes exceeding a specified limit, for example when a three-hourly air temperature observation is at least 50 degrees colder than all others during the day.
4. Rapid change tests conducted in a time series to identify rapid changes exceeding a specified limit, for example when a 100 cm soil temperature suddenly changes in consecutive 3-hourly observations from a relatively stable 22°C to 38°C for all following observations.</p>

<p>Some examples are:
1. Comparing the results of a time series of observations at a given station with those at nearby stations.
2. Using a Barnes or similar analysis to derive spatial patterns against which anomalous and possibly erroneous station values stand out.</p>
