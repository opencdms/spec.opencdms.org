  "text": "This component refers to policies that may be established by the future Climate Data Framework, as discussed in section 11.1.\n\nThis may include, for example:\n1. Common and consistent definitions of key datasets to be maintained by the NMHS, including common dataset names and service names.\n2. A common definition of a climatological day, hour and so forth.\n3. A consistent way of determining data uncertainty.\n4. Common definitions of data quality.\n5. The establishment of a quality assessment classification for derived data.\n6. Authoritative taxonomies and code lists.\n7. Common policies for handling missing data when creating derived data.\n8. Common policies for deriving data when input data have differing levels of quality. For example, policies covering:\n    1. The calculation of monthly averages when daily data are at different levels of quality.\n    2. The generation of derived gridded datasets for a region where data for relevant stations are at different levels of quality.\n9. Common policies for all components discussed within this data policy section (3.1).\n10. The application of best practices for data homogenization techniques.",
