  "text": "This component covers a range of spatial tests to detect inconsistent, unlikely or impossible records and flag them as suspect. A manual investigation may then assess the validity of the suspect values.\n\nSome examples are:\n1. Comparing the results of a time series of observations at a given station with those at nearby stations.\n2. Using a Barnes or similar analysis to derive spatial patterns against which anomalous and possibly erroneous station values stand out.",
