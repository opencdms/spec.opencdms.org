                    <p>This component supports a wide range of user defined business rules that govern how data are ingested into the climate database. Some examples (for observations data) are:
1. Action required when new phenomena are to be ingested but a record already exists in the
database for that time period.
    1. Should the new record replace the current record in the database or should the new record be rejected?</p>
<pre><code>    There is potential for data that have not been quality controlled to overwrite perfectly good quality-controlled data. An example is a message that is reingested and the ingest process does not take into account the possibility that the data already exist in the database and that they have been modified.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Action required when a message arrives for ingest but the message type is not appropriate according to the observations metadata on record for that station.</li>
<li>Action required should a message arrive containing an observed value that is outside the accepted bounds for a given phenomenon. For example, a message contains a value of 90°C for temperature, where the maximum accepted temperature is 60°C.</li>
<li>Action required should a message arrive that is of a lower order of precedence to one that has already been ingested for the same time period and station. For example:<ol>
<li>The priority level given to records being ingested may relate to the method of data acquisition. A record that has been keyed in via a quality assurance process may be given a higher priority than a record acquired via a real-time message ingest.</li>
