  "text": "This component refers to policies that address and explain issues relating to the use of crowdsourced climate data by the NMHS (see Wikipedia article on crowdsourcing).\n\nIn summary, crowdsourcing is about obtaining data from a large pool of volunteers who would like to collaborate with the organization.\n\nCrowdsourcing has considerable potential for enhancing data generated by NMHSs, provided that the data are used appropriately. \n\nThere are many examples of crowdsourcing initiatives that have generated very useful data. Some examples are:\n1. OpenStreetMap\n2. Old Weather \u2013 a data rescue project to digitize meteorological observations from old ship logs\n3. Weather Observations Website (WOW), Met Office (United Kingdom)\n4. Veilleurs du temps, Meteo-France\n\nSome issues that crowdsourcing policies should consider are:\n\n5. Only accepting crowdsourced data when the supplier has agreed to either provide the data under a Creative Commons ShareAlike licence (see Creative Commons ShareAlike page) or to have its intellectual property rights assigned to the NMHS.\n6. Having intellectual property rights to the data recorded for future use.\n7. When the data contributed are observations data:\n    1. Having the contributor commit to providing and maintaining suitable observations metadata for their station(s) and sensor(s).\n    2. Having the contributor agree to appropriate site visits by NMHS staff to assist with quality assurance processes.\n8. Deciding when it is appropriate to use crowdsourced data and under what conditions.\n9. Deciding how the crowdsourced data will be managed.",
