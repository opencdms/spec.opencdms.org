    "text": "This subsection refers to the database(s) used to store and manage a range of time-series data,\nincluding: climate observations, climate metadata (observations, discovery and data provenance),\nspatial information, derived data and related data required for effective data management.\nMore advanced CDMSs may manage the data in a series of related databases rather than in a\nsingle database.\nIt is recommended that the climate database provide support for the following functionalities,\nclassified by priority:\nRequired\n\u2022 Managing core observations described in the Guide to Climatological Practices (WMO-No. 100).\n\u2022 Managing observation metadata (such as station metadata) and integrating them with\nobservations data.\n\u2022 Handling observations from multiple sensors per station, per phenomenon, and recording\nthe source of each observation.\n\u2022 Managing multiple tiers of data quality, from raw records to homogenized data.\n\u2022 Managing spatial and time-series data.\nRecommended\n\u2022 Covering at least the GCOS ECVs.\n\u2022 Using a robust data model that takes into account the requirements of open spatial\nstandards, particularly the ISO 19156:2011 Geographic information \u2013 Observations and\nmeasurements standard, METCE and the WMO climate observations application schema (see\ncomponent 4.2.3.2).\n\u2022 Managing metadata related to data provenance. This entails ensuring that each change to\nan observation is recorded for future recovery, and recording the details of why a particular\nchange was made, which includes:\n\u2013 Tracing the product lineage to the data source. For example, what observations and\ngridded data were used to underpin the analysis released in peer-reviewed paper X?\n\u2013 Ensuring that the reason for each observation change is recorded.\n\u2022 Managing third-party and crowdsourced data.\n\u2022 Managing intellectual property rights related to data.\n\u2022 Enabling point-in-time recovery. For example, what data were present in the database for\nstation X at time T?\n\u2022 Storing a range of document formats, such as:\n\u2013 Photographs of observation stations and instruments, meteorological phenomena, etc.\n\u2013 Scanned paper observation forms\n\u2013 Scanned microfiche/microfilm\n\u2013 Relevant observations metadata documents, such as instrument calibration reports\n\u2013 Technical manuals\n\u2013 Site location plans and sections\n\u2013 Videos and other multimedia formats\nOptional\n\u2022 Handling data uncertainty (for more information, see Wikipedia articles on uncertain data\nand uncertainty).\n\u2022 Managing multidimensional time-series gridded data and possibly numerical models.\n\u2022 Providing support for the information management concepts of semantics and linked data.",

Furthermore, METCE is\na profile of the Observations and measurements\nstandard that provides domain- and applicationspecific\nsemantics for use within the weather,\nwater and climate domains.\nThe initial iteration of METCE and its companion\nmodel, the Observable Property Model, were\ndeveloped by the Task Team on Aviation XML\nto support the ICAO Meteorological Information\nExchange Model.\nHowever, METCE will provide a common\nsemantic basis for a growing number of data\nproducts relating to observation and simulation\nwithin WMO. Not only will this simplify the\nrequirements for software systems working with\nWMO products, it is also expected to simplify\nthe mappings between WMO data products and\ncounterparts from other communities such as CFnetCDF.\nAs at December 2013, plans have been made\nto provide mappings/rules to convert from the\nMETCE application schema to BUFR sequences\nand/or GRIB templates at some point in the future.\nFor more information, please see:\n\u2022 AvXML-1.0 data model\n\u2022 ISO 19109:2005, Geographic information \u2013\nRules for application schema",
