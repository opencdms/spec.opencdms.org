                    <p>This component covers governance processes that ensure that any change to the CDMS is carefully managed.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled change can result in chaos for users of the CDMS, for example:
1. Systems may break down for no known reason.
2. Data corruptions or even data loss may occur and may not be detected at all.
3. Provenance of data is severely impacted, as data managers do not know what algorithms or processes have been applied to the data.
4. Considerable disruption may be experienced by staff that rely on the CDMS for day-to-day activities and may inconvenience users who rely on the data and derived products.
5. Data corruption, data loss and lack of availability of key systems may have a significant impact on the reputation of the NMHS.</p>
<p>Some issues to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>How is the change process managed?</li>
<li>Who needs to be consulted when considering a potential change?</li>
<li>How is the proposed change analysed to assess its potential impact on data integrity and on other CDMS components?</li>
<li>Who can authorize a change?</li>
<li>What testing is required to mitigate the potential impacts of the change and give confidence that the change is desirable?</li>
<li>How can the change be made with minimal impact?</li>
<li>Are there any dependencies between a series of proposed changes that may dictate that the changes occur in a particular order?</li>
<li>How is the change to be made and tested?</li>
<li>If the change fails, how can the system be rolled back to its previous state?</li>
<li>How can CDMS components be implemented such that they are self-testing to support concepts such as continuous integration?</li>
<li>Will processes based on an IT service management framework such as ITIL help improve the management of IT-related changes? (See Wikipedia article on IT service management)</li>
