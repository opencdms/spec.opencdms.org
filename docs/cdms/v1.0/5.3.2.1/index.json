  "text": "This component keeps track of data received from an observational network in order to monitor network performance and potentially detect and alert data managers of possible problems.\n\nSome examples are:\n1. Statistics showing the current state of data ingests compared with historical averages.\n2. Records not received for a station or sensor could indicate a potential issue with the instrumentation, IT equipment, software or IT network.\n3. Specific fields or records not loaded into the database could be an indication of a systematic error such as an undetected software error.\n4. Records received in advance of the observation time may highlight training issues.\n5. Loss of data due to corrupted synoptic message types.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) *Guide to the Global Observing System* (WMO No. 488), section 3.1.3.14 Network performance monitoring",
