  "text": "This component represents a range of technological tools that provide rules and a standardized approach for defining alternative visual portrayals of spatial data via an internal network or the Internet.\n\nSymbology Encoding, together with Styled Layer Descriptors (SLDs), can be used with WMSs, WFSs and WCSs to enable user-defined symbolization of spatial data from within a collection of published styles.\n\nAs an example, it is possible to publish several colour classification schemes for a gridded dataset, allowing end-users to select one that is appropriate for their use.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) OGC Symbology Encoding documentation",
