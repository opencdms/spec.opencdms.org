Data generation of accumulation, averages or extremes, such as generating ten-day data from daily data or daily data from hourly data.\n2. The generation of particular data derived from raw data, such as computing the potential evapotranspiration output for agricultural purposes.\n3. The generation of any statistical parameter required for products, such as extreme value analysis, homogenized data and others.\n4. Climate indices such as computed teleconnection indices.",

Period averages for any period (for example 5, 10, 30 or 100 years)\n\nFor more information, see:\na) *The Role of Climatological Normals in a Changing Climate* (WMO/TD-No. 1377), WCDMP-61",
