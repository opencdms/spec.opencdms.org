                    <p>This component refers to a policy that governs how an organization implements disaster recovery and business continuity solutions and covers issues such as how to handle data backups. Some initial issues to consider are:
1. How important is the climate record?
2. How often should climate data be backed up?</p>
<pre><code>While the Wikipedia article on backups can provide some background information, this question must be answered by each NMHS.

Their answer will need to take the following into account:
1. How important are their data?
2.  How much data can they afford to lose?
3.  How much work can they afford to redo?
4.  In the interim, while NMHSs are assessing their requirements, it is suggested that daily backups be made with weekly off-site storage.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>How many redundant copies of the data should be kept?</li>
<li>What secure off-site facility should be used to store disaster recovery versions of the data?</li>
<li>What is the acceptable downtime for each of the key CDMS applications?</li>
<li>How high is the risk of catastrophic damage to the organization’s infrastructure due to a range of factors, including:<ol>
<li>Natural disasters, such as flooding, bush fires, tidal waves, cyclones or earthquakes?</li>
<li>Man-made disturbances, such as military conflict, terrorism and fires?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Where should the secure off-site storage be located? For NMHSs situated in areas where their infrastructure is likely to be damaged, it may be appropriate to place the secure off-site storage in another city or country.</p>
<p>Is it appropriate to use cloud-based services to store and manage climate data and offer CDMS services to end-users?</p>

                    <p>This component represents a policy that governs how an organization manages and maintains its
climate data.</p>
<p>A data custodian is typically a senior-level manager who is accountable for the integrity of the climate record of the NMHS.</p>
<p>Some examples of a data custodian’s duties are:
1. Preserving the integrity of the climate record, including quality control and ensuring that observational networks provide data that are suitable for climate purposes.
2. Championing the cause of data management to ensure that sufficient funding is allocated and managed effectively so that the climate record remains viable.
3. Facilitating the development and maintenance of suitable policies governing climate data.
4. Ensuring that climate data are effectively managed and maintained.
5. Ensuring that observations metadata, discovery metadata and data provenance are effectively maintained.
6. Formally delegating authority to appropriate staff members, together with related performance accountabilities.
7. Taking primary responsibility for CDMS applications, CDMS enhancement and IT maintenance projects.
8. Ensuring that IT changes do not corrupt the climate record.
9. Implementing and monitoring relevant key performance indicators to help monitor ongoing performance of the CDMS and related processes.</p>

                    <p>This component involves a policy that governs how an organization allows access to data.</p>
<p>Some issues to consider are:
1. How is read-and-write access to climate data controlled?
2. What training is needed before staff are granted write access?
3. What types of controls are needed to monitor and approve changes to the climate record to facilitate data maintenance and error rectification?
4. How are any specific access constraints, such as security, contractual or commercial constraints, to be managed?</p>
<p>Note: The issue of open data is increasing in relevance for many national governments that have made open-data commitments. </p>
<p>Therefore, organizations should have a clear understanding of, and a clear policy for, the provision of NMHS climate data in accordance with open data principles (see Wikipedia article on open data).</p>
<p>In summary, open data is about ensuring that data are freely available for reuse with no constraints apart from perhaps the requirement to acknowledge the data source and ensure that the data are made available under a share-alike agreement.</p>

                    <p>This component refers to policies that address and explain issues relating to the use of crowdsourced climate data by the NMHS (see Wikipedia article on crowdsourcing).</p>
<p>In summary, crowdsourcing is about obtaining data from a large pool of volunteers who would like to collaborate with the organization.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing has considerable potential for enhancing data generated by NMHSs, provided that the data are used appropriately. </p>
<p>There are many examples of crowdsourcing initiatives that have generated very useful data. Some examples are:
1. OpenStreetMap
2. Old Weather – a data rescue project to digitize meteorological observations from old ship logs
3. Weather Observations Website (WOW), Met Office (United Kingdom)
4. Veilleurs du temps, Meteo-France</p>
<p>Some issues that crowdsourcing policies should consider are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only accepting crowdsourced data when the supplier has agreed to either provide the data under a Creative Commons ShareAlike licence (see Creative Commons ShareAlike page) or to have its intellectual property rights assigned to the NMHS.</li>
<li>Having intellectual property rights to the data recorded for future use.</li>
<li>When the data contributed are observations data:<ol>
<li>Having the contributor commit to providing and maintaining suitable observations metadata for their station(s) and sensor(s).</li>
<li>Having the contributor agree to appropriate site visits by NMHS staff to assist with quality assurance processes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Deciding when it is appropriate to use crowdsourced data and under what conditions.</li>
<li>Deciding how the crowdsourced data will be managed.</li>

    2.  Whether there are any restrictions based on the virtualization of the server?
5. Is there a time limit for the use of the data? If so, what must be done with the data at the end of this period?
6. Are the data only available via a subscription service or web service? If so, what impact will this have on NMHS operations in the event of a disruption of the service or when an invoice is not paid on time?
7. Are there any explicit commercial constraints on the use of the data?
8. Are the data actively maintained?
9. Do the costs, constraints and associated risks call for an arrangement to be made between the NMHS and the data provider?
10. Are there alternative datasets of similar functionality and quality that could be obtained elsewhere, such as a community-maintained dataset like OpenStreetMap?</p>

                    <p>This component concerns policies that ensure that the CDMS is able to trace the lineage of climate data from published scientific texts and other papers back to raw observations.</p>
<p>This will include the ability to reproduce specific data that were held in the climate database at a particular point in time. Note that it may not be practical to implement this policy retrospectively, i.e. for papers published in the past.</p>
<p>This specific policy requirement has become increasingly relevant following the so-called Climategate issue. One of the conclusions of the UK parliamentary enquiry that investigated this issue was that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not standard practice in climate science to publish the raw data and the computer code in academic papers. However, climate science is a matter of great importance and the quality of the science should be irreproachable. We therefore consider that climate scientists should take steps to make available all the data that support their work (including raw data) and full methodological workings (including the computer codes).</p>
<p>Had both been available, many of the problems at UEA [University of East Anglia] could have been avoided. (UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee, 2011)</p>

                    <p>This component covers a range of policies that govern the generation and interpretation of observation variables.</p>
<p>As these rules have changed and may change again in the future, the policies will need to cover past, current and future data generation policies.</p>
<p>Some considerations are:
1. These policies will need to cover the methods, algorithms, models and software source code used to generate data.
2. They should include a definition of a climatological day.
3. They should also cover the rules relating to the management of missing observations.</p>
<p>Some inconsistencies have been found in a number of WMO guidelines. For example, conflicting approaches regarding the handling of missing observations when computing a daily or monthly average, and especially regarding the handling of a number of consecutive missing data, are presented in:
a) <em>Guide to Climatological Practices</em> (WMO-No. 100)
b) <em>Calculation of Monthly and Annual 30-Year Standard Normals</em> (WMO/TD-No. 341), WCDP-10
c) <em>Handbook on CLIMAT and CLIMAT TEMP Reporting</em> (WMO/TD-No. 1188)</p>
<p>Inconsistencies in WMO guides have also been noticed regarding the generation and storage of observations data recorded at minute frequency and the generation of hourly observation data. For example, the definition of climatological days may differ:</p>
<ol>
<li>Between NMHSs</li>
<li>Between different stations within a single NMHS</li>
<li>Over time within the same NMHS</li>
<li>Between a given NMHS policy and the method applied by the software used in automatic weather stations (which often appear as a black box to NMHSs). For example, a climatological day could represent the following time periods:<ol>
<li>From 0000 LST to 2300 LST</li>
<li>From 0100 LST to 0000 LST the next day</li>
<li>From 2346 LST the previous day to 2345 LST the current day</li>
<li>From 0900 LST the previous day to 0900 LST the current day</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also inconsistencies due to the use of either local standard time or daylight saving time.</p>
<p>The same issues apply to the definition of a climatological hour.</p>

<p>At reference climatological stations, any change in instrumentation should be such as not to decrease the degree of accuracy of any observations as compared with the earlier observations, and any such change should be preceded by an adequate overlap (at least two years) with the earlier instrumentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>b) <em>Guide to Meteorological Instruments and Methods of Observation</em> (WMO-No. 8), Part II, 1.1.4 Climatological requirements:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The following general guidelines are suggested for a sufficient operational overlap between existing and new automated systems: (i) Wind speed and direction: 12 months (ii) Temperature, humidity, sunshine, evaporation: 24 months (iii) Precipitation: 60 months. (It will often be advantageous to have an ombrometer operated in parallel with the automatic raingauge.) A useful compromise would be an overlap period of 24 months (i.e. two seasonal cycles).</p>
