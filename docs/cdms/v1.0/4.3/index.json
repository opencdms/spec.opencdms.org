    "text": "This subsection covers access to and management of station metadata and platform metadata.\nStation and platform metadata are time-series data that describe how, when and where\nmeteorological observations were made and the conditions they were made under. They are\nused to support a range of activities that allow climate professionals to understand the fitness\nfor purpose of specific data and, in many cases, improve the quality of climate observations\ndata. This type of metadata is referred to as observations metadata in this publication.\nIt is anticipated that application schemas (also known as logical data models) will be developed\nto formally define the structure and content of the information required to describe climate\nobserving stations, sensors and platforms (see the Climate observations application schema\ncomponent (4.2.3.2))\nNote: As a general rule, it will be necessary to record and maintain the details of any change to\nobservations metadata in order to understand the context surrounding specific climate data and\nto support future data homogenization activities. In addition to details of the change, specific\nreference must be made to:\n\u2022 The date/time of the change.\nNote: It may not always be possible to define the exact date of the change, for example when\na change happens between two site visits. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to include a\nperiod of time during which the change occurred.\n\u2022 The reason the change was made.\n\u2022 The beginning and end dates of the prior value.\n\u2022 Any date/time reference will need to be constrained by the appropriate temporal datum to\nensure that date handling is consistently applied.\nFor more information, see:\n\u2022 Guide to Climatological Practices (WMO-No. 100)\n\u2022 Guide to Meteorological Instruments and Methods of Observation (WMO-No. 8)\n\u2022 Guide to the Global Observing System (WMO-No. 488), Appendix III.3 Automatic weather\nstation metadata\n\u2022 Manual on the Global Observing System (WMO-No. 544), Volume I, Attachment III.1 Standard\nset of metadata elements for automatic weather station installations\n\u2022 Discussion paper on stations metadata and the WMO Core Profile (Bannerman, 2012)\n\u2022 Draft paper on the climatological needs for minimum stations metadata in the frame of WMO\npublication No. 9, Volume A (Stuber, 2012)\n\u2022 Guidelines on Climate Metadata and Homogenization (WMO-No. 1186), WCDMP-53",

Typically, this will involve\nparallel observations at the old and new station\nover a period of time (two years, for example).\nIf this is necessary, the time of the move should be\nrecorded, together with current and past location\ndetails.\nThe precision required for the latitude, longitude\nand elevation should be in accordance with\nguidance provided by the Commission for\nInstruments and Methods of Observation.\nWhile not authoritative, the final report of the\nfirst session of the Commission for Instruments\nand Methods of Observation Expert Team on\nStandardization suggests that the precision\nrequired for latitude and longitude measurements\nis one second (of arc), which equates to\napproximately 30 meters at the equator.

    "text": "This subsection refers to the processes, data and governance arrangements that record and\nmanage information relevant to climate data and enable end-users, including data managers,\nscientists and the general public, to develop trust in the integrity of the climate data.\nData provenance allows an end-user to understand the history of each piece of data, and thus\nhelps the user to identify what version of the data was available at any given time.\nThe need for this new type of climate metadata has become more evident following a number\nof attacks on the credibility of climate data. One notable example is the so-called Climategate\nincident and subsequent inquiries.\nTherefore, it is important for NMHSs to establish the reliability of their climate data and\nprocesses and to ensure that these data are subsequently seen as the authoritative source that\ncan be used for global climate studies.\nWhile the concept of data provenance has been relatively nebulous within the information\nmanagement domain for many years, there has been a significant amount of work on the\nconcept within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for over more than a decade, particularly\nwith regard to the development of the PROV standard.\nThe W3C defines provenance as:\n[A] record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing,\ninfluencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information\nis crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with\nother diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In\nan open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often\ncontradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.\n(W3C, 2013a)\nWhile this work is still relatively new, it is showing significant potential for use within the climate\ndomain.\nThe concepts presented here for climate data provenance are quite embryonic and need further\nwork to ensure that they can be implemented effectively. See the related recommendation in\nChapter 11.\nMaintaining a dataset with high levels of data provenance metadata is expected to be quite\nexpensive and, as a result, will be limited to data of high importance such as high-quality\nclimate monitoring datasets. It is anticipated that guidance will be required to suggest what\ndata should be maintained with what level of data provenance metadata. This guidance could\nperhaps be included as a policy within a future climate data framework.\nFor more information, see:\n\u2022 Overview of the PROV family of documents (W3C, 2013b)\n\u2022 PROV data model specification (W3C, 2013a)",
