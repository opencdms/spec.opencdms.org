  "title": "Dataset discovery metadata",
  "text": "This subsection refers to the processes, software and governance arrangements that ensure that discovery metadata are captured, managed and maintained.\n\nDiscovery metadata are intended to facilitate the discovery and assessment of a spatial dataset to determine if it is fit for reuse for a purpose that may be at odds with the reason for which it was originally created.\n\nDiscovery metadata may also be known as WIS metadata. They are not the same as the observations metadata described above.\n\nNote that some of the components below may be in addition to the WMO Core Profile of the ISO 19115 *Geographic information \u2013 Metadata* standard. This is not expected to be an issue as the WMO Core Profile does not restrict the use of additional ISO 19115 records.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) Discussion paper on stations metadata and the WMO Core Profile (Bannerman, 2012)\nb) WMO Core Metadata Profile version 1.3, Part 1 Conformance requirements\nc) WMO Core Metadata Profile version 1.3, Part 2 Abstract test suite, data dictionary and code lists\nd) Tandy (2010) also provides a useful introduction to discovery metadata. However, note that the specifications part of this text has been superseded.\ne) ISO 19115 Geographic information \u2013 Metadata",
