  "text": "This component refers to policies that ensure that quality assurance issues within an organization are clearly understood.\n\nSome issues to consider are:\n1. What level of quality assurance can the organization afford to maintain over the long term?\n2. Will the organization conduct quality assurance checks on all observation phenomena or only on a subset?\n3. What quality assurance levels (or tiers) are used by the organization for the long term?\n4. How is each quality assurance tier defined?\n5. What quality assurance tests must data successfully pass before they are promoted to the next tier?\n6. How could the ISO 9000 series of quality management standards help improve data management processes?\n\nSee:\na) *Technical Regulations* (WMO-No. 49), Volume IV",
