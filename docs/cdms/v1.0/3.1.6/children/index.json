Note that it may not be practical to implement this policy retrospectively, i.e. for papers published in the past.\n\nThis specific policy requirement has become increasingly relevant following the so-called Climategate issue. One of the conclusions of the UK parliamentary enquiry that investigated this issue was that:\n> It is not standard practice in climate science to publish the raw data and the computer code in academic papers. However, climate science is a matter of great importance and the quality of the science should be irreproachable. We therefore consider that climate scientists should take steps to make available all the data that support their work (including raw data) and full methodological workings (including the computer codes).\n>\n> Had both been available, many of the problems at UEA [University of East Anglia] could have been avoided.

    "title": "Data generation",
    "text": "This component covers a range of policies that govern the generation and interpretation of observation variables.\n\nAs these rules have changed and may change again in the future, the policies will need to cover past, current and future data generation policies.\n\nSome considerations are:\n1. These policies will need to cover the methods, algorithms, models and software source code used to generate data.\n2. They should include a definition of a climatological day.\n3. They should also cover the rules relating to the management of missing observations.\n\nSome inconsistencies have been found in a number of WMO guidelines. For example, conflicting approaches regarding the handling of missing observations when computing a daily or monthly average, and especially regarding the handling of a number of consecutive missing data, are presented in:\na) *Guide to Climatological Practices* (WMO-No. 100)\nb) *Calculation of Monthly and Annual 30-Year Standard Normals* (WMO/TD-No. 341), WCDP-10\nc) *Handbook on CLIMAT and CLIMAT TEMP Reporting* (WMO/TD-No. 1188)\n\nInconsistencies in WMO guides have also been noticed regarding the generation and storage of observations data recorded at minute frequency and the generation of hourly observation data. For example, the definition of climatological days may differ:\n\n4. Between NMHSs\n5. Between different stations within a single NMHS\n6. Over time within the same NMHS\n7. Between a given NMHS policy and the method applied by the software used in automatic weather stations (which often appear as a black box to NMHSs). For example, a climatological day could represent the following time periods:\n    1. From 0000 LST to 2300 LST\n    2. From 0100 LST to 0000 LST the next day\n    3. From 2346 LST the previous day to 2345 LST the current day\n    4. From 0900 LST the previous day to 0900 LST the current day\n\nThere are also inconsistencies due to the use of either local standard time or daylight saving time.\n\nThe same issues apply to the definition of a climatological hour.",

(It will often be advantageous to have an ombrometer operated in parallel with the automatic raingauge.) A useful compromise would be an overlap period of 24 months (i.e. two seasonal cycles).\n\nc) *Guidelines on Climate Metadata and Homogenization* (WMO/TD-No. 1186), WCDMP-53",
