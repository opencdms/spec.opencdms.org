  "title": "Manage climate metadata",
  "text": "This subsection refers to the processes, software, governance mechanisms and data analysis required to effectively manage climate metadata, which include metadata on observations, discovery and data provenance.\n\nNote: This subsection is deliberately kept generic in this version of the CDMS Specifications, with all types of climate metadata bundled together. While the Create and Maintain components (5.5.1.1 and 5.5.1.2, respectively) are classified as recommended, in reality data provenance metadata has not yet been adequately defined. Therefore, a pragmatic approach would rightly not address the creation and maintenance of data provenance metadata until this has been rectified. The creation and maintenance of discovery and observations metadata, however, is required.\n\nFor more information on climate metadata, see section 4.3 of this publication.",
