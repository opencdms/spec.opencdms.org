                    <p>This component refers to a policy that governs how an organization implements disaster recovery and business continuity solutions and covers issues such as how to handle data backups. Some initial issues to consider are:
1. How important is the climate record?
2. How often should climate data be backed up?</p>
<pre><code>While the Wikipedia article on backups can provide some background information, this question must be answered by each NMHS.

Their answer will need to take the following into account:
1. How important are their data?
2.  How much data can they afford to lose?
3.  How much work can they afford to redo?
4.  In the interim, while NMHSs are assessing their requirements, it is suggested that daily backups be made with weekly off-site storage.

<ol>
<li>How many redundant copies of the data should be kept?</li>
<li>What secure off-site facility should be used to store disaster recovery versions of the data?</li>
<li>What is the acceptable downtime for each of the key CDMS applications?</li>
<li>How high is the risk of catastrophic damage to the organizationâ€™s infrastructure due to a range of factors, including:<ol>
<li>Natural disasters, such as flooding, bush fires, tidal waves, cyclones or earthquakes?</li>
<li>Man-made disturbances, such as military conflict, terrorism and fires?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Where should the secure off-site storage be located? For NMHSs situated in areas where their infrastructure is likely to be damaged, it may be appropriate to place the secure off-site storage in another city or country.</p>
<p>Is it appropriate to use cloud-based services to store and manage climate data and offer CDMS services to end-users?</p>
