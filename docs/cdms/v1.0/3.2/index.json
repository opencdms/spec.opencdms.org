      "text": "This component refers to strategic IT governance\nprocesses that ensure that CDMSs and related IT\nsystems are carefully designed so that the science\nand NMHS requirements for CDMSs may be\neffectively and efficiently implemented.\nUncontrolled development of components can\nhave adverse impacts on the CDMS, including on\nthe ability of the NMHS to maintain the CDMS over\nthe long term. For example:\n\u2022 Reliance on proprietary solutions provided by a\nsingle vendor could result in a situation known\nas vendor lock-in. As time passes, more and\nmore components are developed based on\nthe single solution. It can be very difficult and\ncostly for a NMHS to move to a new CDMSrelated\nsolution if the current vendor\u2019s product\nbecomes unaffordable or if the vendor goes\nout of business, decides that it is no longer in\nits interest to offer CDMS components, ceases\nto maintain its systems or no longer offers a\ncompetitive CDMS solution.\n\u2022 Similarly, uncontrolled bespoke development\nof CDMS components by NMHS staff or\ncontractors can also be a problem. This may\nresult in a wide variety of disparate CDMS\ncomponents that cannot be easily integrated.\nMany different types of technology could be\nused, resulting in high maintenance costs.\nKey-person dependencies could also develop,\nleaving the NMHS with a significant and costly\nissue to resolve, particularly if the key person\nleaves the organization and the CDMS ceases\nto operate.\n\u2022 CDMS component solutions could be\ndeveloped that do not effectively use NMHS\nclimate data, for example:\n\u2013 Data may be replicated from the climate\ndatabase and made into stand-alone files to\nsupport a particular technology or due to the\ndeveloper\u2019s lack of experience. Whereas the\ndata in the climate database are subject to a\nlengthy quality assurance lifecycle and may\nchange, the replicated data are fixed at a point\nin time and may not be updated to reflect\nlater changes to the climate record. This may\nbecome a significant issue for the NMHS,\nparticularly if this practice is systematically\napplied by many developers, across many\napplications and over many years.\n\u2013 The data extraction process may not take\ninto account quality assurance flags and just\npresent raw observations with no indication\nof data quality or reliability.\n\u2013 Developers may not understand the\ncomplexities of the climate database data\nmodel and extract incorrect data.\n\u2013 Components may have any number of data\ninconsistency or misuse issues. What is the\nimpact on the reputation of the NMHS if the\nsame data are presented with differing values\nby different CDMS components?\nThere may also be architectural considerations\nthat are better off understood early in the CDMS\ndevelopment so that governance processes can\nensure that the considerations are implemented\nwithin developed and/or implemented software.\nOne issue to consider is whether the CDMS\nshould be able to work in multiple languages.\nThe answer to this will have implications for the\ndesign of software for the user interface of CDMS\ncomponents, as well as for the generation and\npresentation of data products.\nIT architecture is a specialized field of information\ntechnology that is typically undertaken by highly\nexperienced professionals with very broad IT\nexperience. Ideally, this task will be conducted\nby experienced NMHS staff to ensure that\nconsistent CDMS components are implemented in\naccordance with a strategic vision.\nSee also Wikipedia articles on:\n\u2022 Enterprise architecture\n\u2022 Solution architecture",
