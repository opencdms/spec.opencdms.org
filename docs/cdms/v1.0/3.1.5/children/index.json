    "text": "This component refers to policies that address and explain issues relating to the use of crowdsourced climate data by the NMHS (see Wikipedia article on crowdsourcing).\n\nIn summary, crowdsourcing is about obtaining data from a large pool of volunteers who would like to collaborate with the organization.\n\nCrowdsourcing has considerable potential for enhancing data generated by NMHSs, provided that the data are used appropriately. \n\nThere are many examples of crowdsourcing initiatives that have generated very useful data. Some examples are:\n1. OpenStreetMap\n2. Old Weather \u2013 a data rescue project to digitize meteorological observations from old ship logs\n3. Weather Observations Website (WOW), Met Office (United Kingdom)\n4. Veilleurs du temps, Meteo-France\n\nSome issues that crowdsourcing policies should consider are:\n\n5. Only accepting crowdsourced data when the supplier has agreed to either provide the data under a Creative Commons ShareAlike licence (see Creative Commons ShareAlike page) or to have its intellectual property rights assigned to the NMHS.\n6. Having intellectual property rights to the data recorded for future use.\n7. When the data contributed are observations data:\n    1. Having the contributor commit to providing and maintaining suitable observations metadata for their station(s) and sensor(s).\n    2. Having the contributor agree to appropriate site visits by NMHS staff to assist with quality assurance processes.\n8. Deciding when it is appropriate to use crowdsourced data and under what conditions.\n9. Deciding how the crowdsourced data will be managed.",

    "text": "This component refers to policies that provide clear explanations of issues regarding the use of climate-related data captured and maintained by government agencies external to the NMHS.\n\nExamples of issues to consider include:\n1. Is there a clear data licence allowing the NMHS to use the data for any relevant purpose, including for internal use, to create derived products, to publish the data on the NMHS website or for data redistribution, if required?\n2. Are there any costs associated with the use of the data?\n3. Is it a high-quality dataset? Do the discovery metadata clearly describe the intended use, lineage and quality assessment of the data?\n4. What constraints apply to the use of the data?\n5. If the data are observations data, are there high-quality metadata available to support CDMS activities?\n6. If the data are of similar quality to NMHS data, share similar functions and help enhance the NMHS data, is the provider willing to consider joint ownership and maintenance of the data?",

    "text": "This component refers to policies that address and clarify issues on the use of climate-related data captured and maintained by commercial organizations.\n\nIn addition to the considerations discussed under the Other agency component (3.1.5.2), other issues that commercial policies should consider include:\n1. What contractual arrangements apply to the use of the data?\n2. What costs apply explicitly to the use of the data?\n3. Are there constraints on the number of users who can access the data at the same time?\n4. Are there pricing qualifications based on the specific server environment that hosts the data, or more specifically on:\n    1. The number of central processing units, processor cores, threads and so forth?\n    2.  Whether there are any restrictions based on the virtualization of the server?\n5. Is there a time limit for the use of the data? If so, what must be done with the data at the end of this period?\n6. Are the data only available via a subscription service or web service? If so, what impact will this have on NMHS operations in the event of a disruption of the service or when an invoice is not paid on time?\n7. Are there any explicit commercial constraints on the use of the data?\n8. Are the data actively maintained?\n9. Do the costs, constraints and associated risks call for an arrangement to be made between the NMHS and the data provider?\n10. Are there alternative datasets of similar functionality and quality that could be obtained elsewhere, such as a community-maintained dataset like OpenStreetMap?",
