  "title": "Multilayer quality flags",
  "text": "This component refers to the processes, software, governance mechanisms and data analysis used to understand and enumerate the quality flags of a specific record of data.\n\nThis will facilitate:\n1. Future analysis that requires data of a specific quality flag value.\n2. Communication on the assessed quality of records.\n\nThe best description to date on how to define this classification may be found in the *Guide to Climatological Practices* (WMO-No. 100), pp. 3\u20138 to 3\u20139. This reference describes a way of flagging quality based on a combination of:\n\n3. Data type (original, corrected, reconstructed or calculated)\n4. Validation stage\n5.  Acquisition method\n\nThis approach is still quite limited. It does not provide a clear way of determining just what level of quality control a record has been subjected to.\n\nWhile the classifications are relevant and relate to the perceived quality of a record, they do not allow for an explicit comparison of data of similar perceived quality.\n\nFor example, the subsection on quality management (5.3.1) describes a series of classifications of tests (without providing actual details). If a record has passed all such tests, can it be considered to be better quality than one that has not passed any test?\n\nObjective quality classifications are required to support a consistent approach within the global WMO community so that data can be:\n\n6. Objectively compared to ensure that data of similar quality can be compared and analysed as required.\n7. Stored and easily retrieved from a climate database. It is becoming increasingly apparent that organizations will need to retain observations at multiple levels of quality from the raw observation through various edit and analysis processes in order to demonstrate the true lineage of a record and explain and justify the changes made to the raw observations.\n\nNote: A more objective approach to determining this classification for the global WMO community is required.",
