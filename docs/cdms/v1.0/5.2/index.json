Most\norganizations will not have suitable controls in place. Therefore, key-in via the Internet should\nbe avoided as a general rule.\n\u2022 NMHS data policy should provide guidelines as to appropriate data quality considerations\napplied to data that are manually entered.",

These checks and\nthe appropriate values are to be customizable\naccording to NMHS data policy and governance\nprocesses.\n\u2022 Ensuring that appropriate data types and\ncontext are entered for each field.\n\u2022 The component should alert the operator\nto any doubtful entries detected, providing\nappropriate advice as per NMHS data policy\nguidelines.",
