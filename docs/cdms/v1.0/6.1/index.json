These equations are the basis\n> for complex computer programs commonly\n> used for simulating the atmosphere or ocean\n> of the Earth. Atmospheric and oceanic GCMs\n> (AGCM and OGCM) are key components of\n> global climate models along with sea ice and\n> land-surface components. GCMs and global\n> climate models are widely applied for weather\n> forecasting, understanding the climate, and\n> projecting climate change.\nSuch climate numerical models could be global in\nscale (like GCMs) but they could also be regional,\nwith generally a higher precision.\nDownscaling techniques are often used when\ncreating regional models.\nModels can be based on:\n\u2022 The rules of physics, biology and chemistry\n\u2022 Statistical rules\n\u2022 A mix of dynamic and statistic methods\nThe use of climate models includes:\n\u2022 Simulation of the present climate\n\u2022 Simulation of the future climate\n\u2022 Palaeoclimate reconstruction\n\u2022 Seasonal forecasts\n\u2022 Decadal prediction\nNote: Most NMHSs would not have the resources\nneeded to effectively manage the infrastructure\nand software required to support this component.\nHowever, the data output from such components\nmay be useful and should be available for NMHSs\nvia a number of sources, including Regional\nClimate Centres.\nFor more information, see:\n\u2022 Wikipedia article on general circulation models",
