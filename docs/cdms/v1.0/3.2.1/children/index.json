What process is in place for designating staff to each role?\n4. What process applies to ensure that access to data is subject to approval by a delegate of the data custodian?\n5. Should users who have write access to data stored within a database only be able to change data under software control?\n6. Should each successful change to observations data be audited to ensure that the change, the details of the operator who made the change and the time of the change have all been recorded?\n\nSome system-related issues to consider are:\n\n7.
