  "text": "This component refers to the processes, software, governance mechanisms and data analysis used to understand and record the uncertainty inherent in gridded data that have been derived from observation data.\n\nMany factors can contribute to the uncertainty inherent in gridded derived data. Some examples are:\n1. Uncertainty inherent in the source observations data.\n2. Uncertainty inherent in the location of sensors/stations used to generate the grids.\n3. The relative accuracy of the algorithms used to generate the derived data.\n4. The precision of variable data types used in the software that generates derived data.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a number of these factors may propagate through the data derivation process.",
