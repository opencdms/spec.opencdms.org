This makes it very difficult to reliably\nintegrate data hosted via DAP with other spatial\ndatasets, including those hosted via open spatial\nservices.\nTherefore, it is considered more appropriate for\ncases in which researchers and scientists only\nwant the data for numerical analysis.\nFor more information, see:\n\u2022 OPeNDAP Wikipedia page\n\u2022 DAP 2.0 Specification",
