This makes it very difficult to reliably integrate data hosted via DAP with other spatial datasets, including those hosted via open spatial services.\n\nTherefore, it is considered more appropriate for cases in which researchers and scientists only want the data for numerical analysis.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) OPeNDAP Wikipedia page\nb) DAP 2.0 Specification",
