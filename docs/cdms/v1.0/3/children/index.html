                    <p>This component refers to a policy that governs how an organization implements disaster recovery and business continuity solutions and covers issues such as how to handle data backups. Some initial issues to consider are:
1. How important is the climate record?
2. How often should climate data be backed up?</p>
<pre><code>While the Wikipedia article on backups can provide some background information, this question must be answered by each NMHS.

Their answer will need to take the following into account:
1. How important are their data?
2.  How much data can they afford to lose?
3.  How much work can they afford to redo?
4.  In the interim, while NMHSs are assessing their requirements, it is suggested that daily backups be made with weekly off-site storage.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>How many redundant copies of the data should be kept?</li>
<li>What secure off-site facility should be used to store disaster recovery versions of the data?</li>
<li>What is the acceptable downtime for each of the key CDMS applications?</li>
<li>How high is the risk of catastrophic damage to the organization’s infrastructure due to a range of factors, including:<ol>
<li>Natural disasters, such as flooding, bush fires, tidal waves, cyclones or earthquakes?</li>
<li>Man-made disturbances, such as military conflict, terrorism and fires?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Where should the secure off-site storage be located? For NMHSs situated in areas where their infrastructure is likely to be damaged, it may be appropriate to place the secure off-site storage in another city or country.</p>
<p>Is it appropriate to use cloud-based services to store and manage climate data and offer CDMS services to end-users?</p>

                    <p>This component represents a policy that governs how an organization manages and maintains its
climate data.</p>
<p>A data custodian is typically a senior-level manager who is accountable for the integrity of the climate record of the NMHS.</p>
<p>Some examples of a data custodian’s duties are:
1. Preserving the integrity of the climate record, including quality control and ensuring that observational networks provide data that are suitable for climate purposes.
2. Championing the cause of data management to ensure that sufficient funding is allocated and managed effectively so that the climate record remains viable.
3. Facilitating the development and maintenance of suitable policies governing climate data.
4. Ensuring that climate data are effectively managed and maintained.
5. Ensuring that observations metadata, discovery metadata and data provenance are effectively maintained.
6. Formally delegating authority to appropriate staff members, together with related performance accountabilities.
7. Taking primary responsibility for CDMS applications, CDMS enhancement and IT maintenance projects.
8. Ensuring that IT changes do not corrupt the climate record.
9. Implementing and monitoring relevant key performance indicators to help monitor ongoing performance of the CDMS and related processes.</p>

                    <p>This component involves a policy that governs how an organization allows access to data.</p>
<p>Some issues to consider are:
1. How is read-and-write access to climate data controlled?
2. What training is needed before staff are granted write access?
3. What types of controls are needed to monitor and approve changes to the climate record to facilitate data maintenance and error rectification?
4. How are any specific access constraints, such as security, contractual or commercial constraints, to be managed?</p>
<p>Note: The issue of open data is increasing in relevance for many national governments that have made open-data commitments. </p>
<p>Therefore, organizations should have a clear understanding of, and a clear policy for, the provision of NMHS climate data in accordance with open data principles (see Wikipedia article on open data).</p>
<p>In summary, open data is about ensuring that data are freely available for reuse with no constraints apart from perhaps the requirement to acknowledge the data source and ensure that the data are made available under a share-alike agreement.</p>

<p>In summary, crowdsourcing is about obtaining data from a large pool of volunteers who would like to collaborate with the organization.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing has considerable potential for enhancing data generated by NMHSs, provided that the data are used appropriately. </p>
<p>There are many examples of crowdsourcing initiatives that have generated very useful data. Some examples are:
1. OpenStreetMap
2. Old Weather – a data rescue project to digitize meteorological observations from old ship logs
3. Weather Observations Website (WOW), Met Office (United Kingdom)
4. Veilleurs du temps, Meteo-France</p>
<p>Some issues that crowdsourcing policies should consider are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only accepting crowdsourced data when the supplier has agreed to either provide the data under a Creative Commons ShareAlike licence (see Creative Commons ShareAlike page) or to have its intellectual property rights assigned to the NMHS.</li>
<li>Having intellectual property rights to the data recorded for future use.</li>
<li>When the data contributed are observations data:<ol>
<li>Having the contributor commit to providing and maintaining suitable observations metadata for their station(s) and sensor(s).</li>
<li>Having the contributor agree to appropriate site visits by NMHS staff to assist with quality assurance processes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Deciding when it is appropriate to use crowdsourced data and under what conditions.</li>

                    <p>This component concerns policies that ensure that the CDMS is able to trace the lineage of climate data from published scientific texts and other papers back to raw observations.</p>
<p>This will include the ability to reproduce specific data that were held in the climate database at a particular point in time. Note that it may not be practical to implement this policy retrospectively, i.e. for papers published in the past.</p>
<p>This specific policy requirement has become increasingly relevant following the so-called Climategate issue. One of the conclusions of the UK parliamentary enquiry that investigated this issue was that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not standard practice in climate science to publish the raw data and the computer code in academic papers. However, climate science is a matter of great importance and the quality of the science should be irreproachable. We therefore consider that climate scientists should take steps to make available all the data that support their work (including raw data) and full methodological workings (including the computer codes).</p>
<p>Had both been available, many of the problems at UEA [University of East Anglia] could have been avoided. (UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee, 2011)</p>

                    <p>This component covers a range of policies that govern the generation and interpretation of observation variables.</p>
<p>As these rules have changed and may change again in the future, the policies will need to cover past, current and future data generation policies.</p>
<p>Some considerations are:
1. These policies will need to cover the methods, algorithms, models and software source code used to generate data.
2. They should include a definition of a climatological day.
3. They should also cover the rules relating to the management of missing observations.</p>
<p>Some inconsistencies have been found in a number of WMO guidelines. For example, conflicting approaches regarding the handling of missing observations when computing a daily or monthly average, and especially regarding the handling of a number of consecutive missing data, are presented in:
a) <em>Guide to Climatological Practices</em> (WMO-No. 100)
b) <em>Calculation of Monthly and Annual 30-Year Standard Normals</em> (WMO/TD-No. 341), WCDP-10
c) <em>Handbook on CLIMAT and CLIMAT TEMP Reporting</em> (WMO/TD-No. 1188)</p>
<p>Inconsistencies in WMO guides have also been noticed regarding the generation and storage of observations data recorded at minute frequency and the generation of hourly observation data. For example, the definition of climatological days may differ:</p>
<ol>
<li>Between NMHSs</li>
<li>Between different stations within a single NMHS</li>
<li>Over time within the same NMHS</li>
<li>Between a given NMHS policy and the method applied by the software used in automatic weather stations (which often appear as a black box to NMHSs). For example, a climatological day could represent the following time periods:<ol>
<li>From 0000 LST to 2300 LST</li>
<li>From 0100 LST to 0000 LST the next day</li>
<li>From 2346 LST the previous day to 2345 LST the current day</li>
<li>From 0900 LST the previous day to 0900 LST the current day</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also inconsistencies due to the use of either local standard time or daylight saving time.</p>
<p>The same issues apply to the definition of a climatological hour.</p>

<p>The following general guidelines are suggested for a sufficient operational overlap between existing and new automated systems: (i) Wind speed and direction: 12 months (ii) Temperature, humidity, sunshine, evaporation: 24 months (iii) Precipitation: 60 months. (It will often be advantageous to have an ombrometer operated in parallel with the automatic raingauge.) A useful compromise would be an overlap period of 24 months (i.e. two seasonal cycles).</p>

<p>Good project managers and project governance processes can mean the difference between a project delivering desired results or the same project failing at great expense, frustrating users and possibly corrupting the climate record.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled enhancement can result in:
1. An undesirable functionality added to the CDMS.
2. Lower-priority work undertaken at the expense of higher-priority tasks.
3. The development of activities that do not have a clearly defined scope, set of deliverables, timeline and budget.</p>
<p>Some additional considerations include:</p>
<ol>
<li>How is the business benefit for a proposed project defined and assessed?</li>
<li>How are the relative priorities of projects assessed?</li>
<li>How are projects managed? What approach is adopted?</li>
<li>What process is used to monitor the progress of a project?</li>
<li>How are the project deliverables assessed to ensure that they meet requirements?</li>
<li>What lessons can be learned from a finished project?</li>
</ol>

                <td class="cdms-content">
                    <p>This component refers to strategic IT governance processes that ensure that CDMSs and related IT systems are carefully designed so that the science and NMHS requirements for CDMSs may be effectively and efficiently implemented.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled development of components can have adverse impacts on the CDMS, including on the ability of the NMHS to maintain the CDMS over the long term. For example:
1. Reliance on proprietary solutions provided by a single vendor could result in a situation known as vendor lock-in. As time passes, more and more components are developed based on the single solution. It can be very difficult and costly for a NMHS to move to a new CDMS-related solution if the current vendor’s product becomes unaffordable or if the vendor goes out of business, decides that it is no longer in its interest to offer CDMS components, ceases to maintain its systems or no longer offers a competitive CDMS solution.
2. Similarly, uncontrolled bespoke development of CDMS components by NMHS staff or contractors can also be a problem. This may result in a wide variety of disparate CDMS components that cannot be easily integrated. Many different types of technology could be used, resulting in high maintenance costs. Key-person dependencies could also develop, leaving the NMHS with a significant and costly issue to resolve, particularly if the key person leaves the organization and the CDMS ceases to operate.
3. CDMS component solutions could be developed that do not effectively use NMHS climate data, for example:
    1. Data may be replicated from the climate database and made into stand-alone files to support a particular technology or due to the developer’s lack of experience. Whereas the data in the climate database are subject to a lengthy quality assurance lifecycle and may change, the replicated data are fixed at a point in time and may not be updated to reflect later changes to the climate record. This may become a significant issue for the NMHS, particularly if this practice is systematically applied by many developers, across many applications and over many years.
    2. The data extraction process may not take into account quality assurance flags and just present raw observations with no indication of data quality or reliability.
    3. Developers may not understand the complexities of the climate database data model and extract incorrect data.
    4. Components may have any number of data inconsistency or misuse issues. What is the impact on the reputation of the NMHS if the same data are presented with differing values by different CDMS components?</p>
<p>There may also be architectural considerations that are better off understood early in the CDMS development so that governance processes can ensure that the considerations are implemented within developed and/or implemented software.</p>
<p>One issue to consider is whether the CDMS should be able to work in multiple languages. The answer to this will have implications for the design of software for the user interface of CDMS components, as well as for the generation and presentation of data products.</p>
<p>IT architecture is a specialized field of information technology that is typically undertaken by highly experienced professionals with very broad IT experience. Ideally, this task will be conducted by experienced NMHS staff to ensure that consistent CDMS components are implemented in accordance with a strategic vision.</p>
