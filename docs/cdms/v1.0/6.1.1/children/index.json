    "title": "Numerical models",
    "text": "This component represents the software, processes and governance mechanisms that provide numerical models such as general circulation models (GCMs), also known as global climate models.\n\nA Wikipedia article defines general circulation models as:\n> [A] mathematical model of the general circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean and based on the Navier\u2013Stokes equations on a rotating sphere with thermodynamic terms for various energy sources (radiation, latent heat). These equations are the basis for complex computer programs commonly used for simulating the atmosphere or ocean of the Earth. Atmospheric and oceanic GCMs (AGCM and OGCM) are key components of **global climate models** along with sea ice and land-surface components. GCMs and global climate models are widely applied for weather forecasting, understanding the climate, and projecting climate change.\n\nSuch climate numerical models could be global in scale (like GCMs) but they could also be regional, with generally a higher precision.\n\nDownscaling techniques are often used when creating regional models.\n\nModels can be based on:\n1. The rules of physics, biology and chemistry\n2. Statistical rules\n3. A mix of dynamic and statistic methods\n\nThe use of climate models includes:\n\n4. Simulation of the present climate\n5. Simulation of the future climate\n6. Palaeoclimate reconstruction\n7. Seasonal forecasts\n8. Decadal prediction\n\nNote: Most NMHSs would not have the resources needed to effectively manage the infrastructure and software required to support this component. However, the data output from such components may be useful and should be available for NMHSs via a number of sources, including Regional Climate Centres.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) Wikipedia article on general circulation models",
