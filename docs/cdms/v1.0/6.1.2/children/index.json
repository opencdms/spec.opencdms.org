Generating grids that show the spatial distribution of observations of a phenomenon such as precipitation.\n2. Generating grids that represent the distribution of the average maximum temperature for the month of May for climatological standard normals.\n3. Generating grids that represent the distribution of the maximum temperature anomalies for May 2010 when compared to the climatological standard normal.\n4. Selecting all meteorological stations located within a 10 km radius around a national administrative boundary.",

Processing remotely sensed satellite imagery to measure the relative solar reflectance of a satellite image, determine the cloud cover within a scene or generate a normalized difference vegetation index to measure vegetation greenness.\n2. Processing ground-based radar imagery to detect rain and storm activity.",
