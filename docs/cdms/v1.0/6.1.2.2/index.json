  "text": "This component covers the software, processes and governance tools that handle a very wide range of image analysis techniques.\n\nSome examples are:\n1. Processing remotely sensed satellite imagery to measure the relative solar reflectance of a satellite image, determine the cloud cover within a scene or generate a normalized difference vegetation index to measure vegetation greenness.\n2. Processing ground-based radar imagery to detect rain and storm activity.",
