                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This section has been included because open spatial standards are seen as a mechanism that is being increasingly adopted by many organizations and industry sectors around the world. These types of services underpin global attempts at making data easily accessible through initiatives such as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) (see GEOSS web page). The WMO Information System can be considered as a component of GEOSS.

Open spatial standards are being increasingly supported by a wide range of off-the-shelf software, including traditional desktop GIS software, making it easier for users to access data that are served via such services.

This is particularly important for CDMSs, as there is a large potential user base that does not routinely use climate data but could benefit from having a reliable source from which to take the data to ensure consistent use across industry. Some examples of growing interest in climate data can be found in sectors such as agriculture, emergency services, aquaculture, fishing, tourism, transportation, health and environment. Such industries typically do not understand WMO data formats such as BUFR or GRIB, nor do they understand how to exploit data delivered in such formats.

While developing countries may not have reliable access to the Internet to take advantage of external open spatial services, it would certainly be possible to use them within their own internal local area networks, particularly as a means to visualize their data.

In short, open spatial standards are expected to become an increasingly important mechanism for distributing data in future years.

Note: The open spatial components presented below are indicative of the types of standards and services that are available and appropriate for the delivery of climate data. These components are not intended to be exhaustive as there are many more services and standards that are also relevant. It is anticipated that this will be expanded upon in future revisions of this publication.

<p>In theory, end-users could subscribe to a data source and have changes to the data replicated in their copy of the data.</p>
<p>In summary, geosynchronization services are expected to support several processes, including:
1. Allowing interested parties to subscribe to an authoritative data source.
2. Data entry with validation.
3. Notifying interested parties of changes.
4. Allowing replication of the data provider’s features.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that geosynchronization services will support crowdsourced data and processes in addition to authoritative data sources.</p>
<p>At present, geosynchronization services are being developed with the current version of a standard that only serves data via a WFS. </p>
<p>It is expected that geosynchronization will support additional services in the future, including WCS and WMS.</p>

                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Application schemas (as defined in ISO 19109:2005 Geographic information – Rules for application schema) provide an abstract representation of the content and structure of information resources. The Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2) outlines the use of application schemas specifically developed for the climate domain.

These abstract representations of information provide the basis for deriving concrete encodings or data formats that allow the information to be serialized for exchange between systems and organizations.

Work is proceeding within WMO to harmonize existing TDCFs (FM 92 GRIB Edition 2 and FM 94 BUFR Edition 4) with WMO METCE (described in the METCE component (4.2.3.1)), with the intent to bind those existing data formats to explicit, well-understood semantics.

In addition, the application schema can be used to develop XML-based data encodings using widely supported open standards for geographic information. The ISO 19136:2007 Geographic information – Geography Markup Language (GML) standard provides rules for serializing the abstract data model expressed as an application schema via XML encoding to create a GML
application schema.

In summary:
1. An application schema can be thought of as a logical data model. For more information, see the subsection on WMO logical data models (4.2.3).
2. A GML application schema is a physical model that is derived from a logical data model published using a particular technology - which in this case is GML. For an example, see the Combined climate observations and metadata component (8.1.2.1) below.

Deriving a GML application schema from an application schema developed specifically for the climate domain (see Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2)) is anticipated to make climate data far more readily consumable for a broader community of users such as those interested in determining the impacts of climate change.

While work has been conducted for several years, this task is still in its early stages as at December 2013. It is expected to take a number of years to complete. For an overview of how a logical data model (and associated application schema) could be used
with climate data, see Bannerman (2012), pp. 20–26.

For a more detailed description of what has been done to date, see Tandy (2013a), which provides an overview of the direction that WMO logical data model work is taking with regard to METCE.</div>
