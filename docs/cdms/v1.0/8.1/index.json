The Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2)\noutlines the use of application schemas specifically developed for the climate domain.\nThese abstract representations of information provide the basis for deriving concrete encodings\nor data formats that allow the information to be serialized for exchange between systems and\norganizations.\nWork is proceeding within WMO to harmonize existing TDCFs (FM 92 GRIB Edition 2 and FM\n94 BUFR Edition 4) with WMO METCE (described in the METCE component (4.2.3.1)), with the\nintent to bind those existing data formats to explicit, well-understood semantics.\nIn addition, the application schema can be used to develop XML-based data encodings using\nwidely supported open standards for geographic information. The ISO 19136:2007 Geographic\ninformation \u2013 Geography Markup Language (GML) standard provides rules for serializing the\nabstract data model expressed as an application schema via XML encoding to create a GML\napplication schema.\nIn summary:\n\u2022 An application schema can be thought of as a logical data model. For more information, see\nthe subsection on WMO logical data models (4.2.3).\n\u2022 A GML application schema is a physical model that is derived from a logical data model\npublished using a particular technology \u2013 which in this case is GML. For an example, see the\nCombined climate observations and metadata component (8.1.2.1) below.\nDeriving a GML application schema from an application schema developed specifically for\nthe climate domain (see Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2)) is\nanticipated to make climate data far more readily consumable for a broader community of users\nsuch as those interested in determining the impacts of climate change.\nWhile work has been conducted for several years, this task is still in its early stages as at\nDecember 2013. It is expected to take a number of years to complete.\nFor an overview of how a logical data model (and associated application schema) could be used\nwith climate data, see Bannerman (2012), pp. 20\u201326.\nFor a more detailed description of what has been done to date, see Tandy (2013a), which provides\nan overview of the direction that WMO logical data model work is taking with regard to METCE.",
