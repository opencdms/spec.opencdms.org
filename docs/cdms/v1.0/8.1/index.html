                        Open spatial standards
                    </h3>
                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This section has been included because open spatial standards are seen as a mechanism that is being increasingly adopted by many organizations and industry sectors around the world. These types of services underpin global attempts at making data easily accessible through initiatives such as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) (see GEOSS web page). The WMO Information System can be considered as a component of GEOSS.

Open spatial standards are being increasingly supported by a wide range of off-the-shelf software, including traditional desktop GIS software, making it easier for users to access data that are served via such services.

This is particularly important for CDMSs, as there is a large potential user base that does not routinely use climate data but could benefit from having a reliable source from which to take the data to ensure consistent use across industry. Some examples of growing interest in climate data can be found in sectors such as agriculture, emergency services, aquaculture, fishing, tourism, transportation, health and environment. Such industries typically do not understand WMO data formats such as BUFR or GRIB, nor do they understand how to exploit data delivered in such formats.

While developing countries may not have reliable access to the Internet to take advantage of external open spatial services, it would certainly be possible to use them within their own internal local area networks, particularly as a means to visualize their data.

In short, open spatial standards are expected to become an increasingly important mechanism for distributing data in future years.

Note: The open spatial components presented below are indicative of the types of standards and services that are available and appropriate for the delivery of climate data. These components are not intended to be exhaustive as there are many more services and standards that are also relevant. It is anticipated that this will be expanded upon in future revisions of this publication.

2. The Open-source Geospatial Foundation overview of OGC standards (see OSGeo Live).
3. The Geonovum wiki, which provides an overview of open spatial standards. This wiki is an initiative of the National Spatial Data Infrastructure executive committee in the Netherlands.
4. The OGC Abstract Specifications, which provide a more detailed theoretical overview of the theory and rationale underpinning open spatial standards.
