Some\nexamples (for observations data) are:\n\u2022 Action required when new phenomena are to\nbe ingested but a record already exists in the\ndatabase for that time period.\n\u2013 Should the new record replace the current\nrecord in the database or should the new\nrecord be rejected?\nThere is potential for data that have not\nbeen quality controlled to overwrite\nperfectly good quality-controlled data. An\nexample is a message that is reingested\nand the ingest process does not take into\naccount the possibility that the data already\nexist in the database and that they have\nbeen modified.\n\u2022 Action required when a message arrives for\ningest but the message type is not appropriate\naccording to the observations metadata on\nrecord for that station.\n\u2022 Action required should a message arrive\ncontaining an observed value that is outside the\naccepted bounds for a given phenomenon. For\nexample, a message contains a value of 90\u00b0C\nfor temperature, where the maximum accepted\ntemperature is 60\u00b0C.\n\u2022 Action required should a message arrive that is\nof a lower order of precedence to one that has\nalready been ingested for the same time period\nand station. For example:\n\u2013 The priority level given to records being\ningested may relate to the method of data\nacquisition. A record that has been keyed in\nvia a quality assurance process may be given\na higher priority than a record acquired via a\nreal-time message ingest.",
