                    </h4>
                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This subsection refers to the processes, data and governance arrangements that record and manage information relevant to climate data and enable end-users, including data managers, scientists and the general public, to develop trust in the integrity of the climate data.

Data provenance allows an end-user to understand the history of each piece of data, and thus helps the user to identify what version of the data was available at any given time. The need for this new type of climate metadata has become more evident following a number of attacks on the credibility of climate data. One notable example is the so-called Climategate
incident and subsequent inquiries.

Therefore, it is important for NMHSs to establish the reliability of their climate data and processes and to ensure that these data are subsequently seen as the authoritative source that can be used for global climate studies.

While the concept of data provenance has been relatively nebulous within the information management domain for many years, there has been a significant amount of work on the concept within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for over more than a decade, particularly with regard to the development of the PROV standard.

The W3C defines provenance as:
&gt; [A] record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing,
&gt; influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information
&gt; is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with
&gt; other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In
&gt; an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often
&gt; contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.
&gt; (W3C, 2013a)

While this work is still relatively new, it is showing significant potential for use within the climate domain.

The concepts presented here for climate data provenance are quite embryonic and need further work to ensure that they can be implemented effectively. See the related recommendation in Chapter 11.

Maintaining a dataset with high levels of data provenance metadata is expected to be quite expensive and, as a result, will be limited to data of high importance such as high-quality climate monitoring datasets. It is anticipated that guidance will be required to suggest what data should be maintained with what level of data provenance metadata. This guidance could perhaps be included as a policy within a future climate data framework.
