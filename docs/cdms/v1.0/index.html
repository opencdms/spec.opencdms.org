                                                <p>This component refers to a policy that governs how an organization implements disaster recovery and business continuity solutions and covers issues such as how to handle data backups. Some initial issues to consider are:
1. How important is the climate record?
2. How often should climate data be backed up?</p>
<pre><code>While the Wikipedia article on backups can provide some background information, this question must be answered by each NMHS.

Their answer will need to take the following into account:
1. How important are their data?
2.  How much data can they afford to lose?
3.  How much work can they afford to redo?
4.  In the interim, while NMHSs are assessing their requirements, it is suggested that daily backups be made with weekly off-site storage.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>How many redundant copies of the data should be kept?</li>
<li>What secure off-site facility should be used to store disaster recovery versions of the data?</li>
<li>What is the acceptable downtime for each of the key CDMS applications?</li>
<li>How high is the risk of catastrophic damage to the organization’s infrastructure due to a range of factors, including:<ol>
<li>Natural disasters, such as flooding, bush fires, tidal waves, cyclones or earthquakes?</li>
<li>Man-made disturbances, such as military conflict, terrorism and fires?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Where should the secure off-site storage be located? For NMHSs situated in areas where their infrastructure is likely to be damaged, it may be appropriate to place the secure off-site storage in another city or country.</p>
<p>Is it appropriate to use cloud-based services to store and manage climate data and offer CDMS services to end-users?</p>

climate data.</p>
<p>A data custodian is typically a senior-level manager who is accountable for the integrity of the climate record of the NMHS.</p>
<p>Some examples of a data custodian’s duties are:
1. Preserving the integrity of the climate record, including quality control and ensuring that observational networks provide data that are suitable for climate purposes.
2. Championing the cause of data management to ensure that sufficient funding is allocated and managed effectively so that the climate record remains viable.
3. Facilitating the development and maintenance of suitable policies governing climate data.
4. Ensuring that climate data are effectively managed and maintained.
5. Ensuring that observations metadata, discovery metadata and data provenance are effectively maintained.
6. Formally delegating authority to appropriate staff members, together with related performance accountabilities.
7. Taking primary responsibility for CDMS applications, CDMS enhancement and IT maintenance projects.
8. Ensuring that IT changes do not corrupt the climate record.
9. Implementing and monitoring relevant key performance indicators to help monitor ongoing performance of the CDMS and related processes.</p>

<p>Some issues to consider are:
1. How is read-and-write access to climate data controlled?
2. What training is needed before staff are granted write access?
3. What types of controls are needed to monitor and approve changes to the climate record to facilitate data maintenance and error rectification?
4. How are any specific access constraints, such as security, contractual or commercial constraints, to be managed?</p>
<p>Note: The issue of open data is increasing in relevance for many national governments that have made open-data commitments. </p>
<p>Therefore, organizations should have a clear understanding of, and a clear policy for, the provision of NMHS climate data in accordance with open data principles (see Wikipedia article on open data).</p>
<p>In summary, open data is about ensuring that data are freely available for reuse with no constraints apart from perhaps the requirement to acknowledge the data source and ensure that the data are made available under a share-alike agreement.</p>

<p>In summary, crowdsourcing is about obtaining data from a large pool of volunteers who would like to collaborate with the organization.</p>
<p>Crowdsourcing has considerable potential for enhancing data generated by NMHSs, provided that the data are used appropriately. </p>
<p>There are many examples of crowdsourcing initiatives that have generated very useful data. Some examples are:
1. OpenStreetMap
2. Old Weather – a data rescue project to digitize meteorological observations from old ship logs
3. Weather Observations Website (WOW), Met Office (United Kingdom)
4. Veilleurs du temps, Meteo-France</p>
<p>Some issues that crowdsourcing policies should consider are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only accepting crowdsourced data when the supplier has agreed to either provide the data under a Creative Commons ShareAlike licence (see Creative Commons ShareAlike page) or to have its intellectual property rights assigned to the NMHS.</li>
<li>Having intellectual property rights to the data recorded for future use.</li>
<li>When the data contributed are observations data:<ol>
<li>Having the contributor commit to providing and maintaining suitable observations metadata for their station(s) and sensor(s).</li>
<li>Having the contributor agree to appropriate site visits by NMHS staff to assist with quality assurance processes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Deciding when it is appropriate to use crowdsourced data and under what conditions.</li>
<li>Deciding how the crowdsourced data will be managed.</li>

<p>This will include the ability to reproduce specific data that were held in the climate database at a particular point in time. Note that it may not be practical to implement this policy retrospectively, i.e. for papers published in the past.</p>
<p>This specific policy requirement has become increasingly relevant following the so-called Climategate issue. One of the conclusions of the UK parliamentary enquiry that investigated this issue was that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not standard practice in climate science to publish the raw data and the computer code in academic papers. However, climate science is a matter of great importance and the quality of the science should be irreproachable. We therefore consider that climate scientists should take steps to make available all the data that support their work (including raw data) and full methodological workings (including the computer codes).</p>
<p>Had both been available, many of the problems at UEA [University of East Anglia] could have been avoided. (UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee, 2011)</p>

                                                <p>This component covers a range of policies that govern the generation and interpretation of observation variables.</p>
<p>As these rules have changed and may change again in the future, the policies will need to cover past, current and future data generation policies.</p>
<p>Some considerations are:
1. These policies will need to cover the methods, algorithms, models and software source code used to generate data.
2. They should include a definition of a climatological day.
3. They should also cover the rules relating to the management of missing observations.</p>
<p>Some inconsistencies have been found in a number of WMO guidelines. For example, conflicting approaches regarding the handling of missing observations when computing a daily or monthly average, and especially regarding the handling of a number of consecutive missing data, are presented in:
a) <em>Guide to Climatological Practices</em> (WMO-No. 100)
b) <em>Calculation of Monthly and Annual 30-Year Standard Normals</em> (WMO/TD-No. 341), WCDP-10
c) <em>Handbook on CLIMAT and CLIMAT TEMP Reporting</em> (WMO/TD-No. 1188)</p>
<p>Inconsistencies in WMO guides have also been noticed regarding the generation and storage of observations data recorded at minute frequency and the generation of hourly observation data. For example, the definition of climatological days may differ:</p>
<ol>
<li>Between NMHSs</li>
<li>Between different stations within a single NMHS</li>
<li>Over time within the same NMHS</li>
<li>Between a given NMHS policy and the method applied by the software used in automatic weather stations (which often appear as a black box to NMHSs). For example, a climatological day could represent the following time periods:<ol>
<li>From 0000 LST to 2300 LST</li>
<li>From 0100 LST to 0000 LST the next day</li>
<li>From 2346 LST the previous day to 2345 LST the current day</li>
<li>From 0900 LST the previous day to 0900 LST the current day</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also inconsistencies due to the use of either local standard time or daylight saving time.</p>
<p>The same issues apply to the definition of a climatological hour.</p>

<p>The following general guidelines are suggested for a sufficient operational overlap between existing and new automated systems: (i) Wind speed and direction: 12 months (ii) Temperature, humidity, sunshine, evaporation: 24 months (iii) Precipitation: 60 months. (It will often be advantageous to have an ombrometer operated in parallel with the automatic raingauge.) A useful compromise would be an overlap period of 24 months (i.e. two seasonal cycles).</p>

<p>Uncontrolled change can result in chaos for users of the CDMS, for example:
1. Systems may break down for no known reason.

3. Provenance of data is severely impacted, as data managers do not know what algorithms or processes have been applied to the data.
4. Considerable disruption may be experienced by staff that rely on the CDMS for day-to-day activities and may inconvenience users who rely on the data and derived products.
5. Data corruption, data loss and lack of availability of key systems may have a significant impact on the reputation of the NMHS.</p>
<p>Some issues to consider:</p>

<li>What testing is required to mitigate the potential impacts of the change and give confidence that the change is desirable?</li>
<li>How can the change be made with minimal impact?</li>
<li>Are there any dependencies between a series of proposed changes that may dictate that the changes occur in a particular order?</li>
<li>How is the change to be made and tested?</li>
<li>If the change fails, how can the system be rolled back to its previous state?</li>
<li>How can CDMS components be implemented such that they are self-testing to support concepts such as continuous integration?</li>
<li>Will processes based on an IT service management framework such as ITIL help improve the management of IT-related changes? (See Wikipedia article on IT service management)</li>

<p>Good project managers and project governance processes can mean the difference between a project delivering desired results or the same project failing at great expense, frustrating users and possibly corrupting the climate record.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled enhancement can result in:
1. An undesirable functionality added to the CDMS.
2. Lower-priority work undertaken at the expense of higher-priority tasks.
3. The development of activities that do not have a clearly defined scope, set of deliverables, timeline and budget.</p>

                                                <p>This component refers to strategic IT governance processes that ensure that CDMSs and related IT systems are carefully designed so that the science and NMHS requirements for CDMSs may be effectively and efficiently implemented.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled development of components can have adverse impacts on the CDMS, including on the ability of the NMHS to maintain the CDMS over the long term. For example:
1. Reliance on proprietary solutions provided by a single vendor could result in a situation known as vendor lock-in. As time passes, more and more components are developed based on the single solution. It can be very difficult and costly for a NMHS to move to a new CDMS-related solution if the current vendor’s product becomes unaffordable or if the vendor goes out of business, decides that it is no longer in its interest to offer CDMS components, ceases to maintain its systems or no longer offers a competitive CDMS solution.
2. Similarly, uncontrolled bespoke development of CDMS components by NMHS staff or contractors can also be a problem. This may result in a wide variety of disparate CDMS components that cannot be easily integrated. Many different types of technology could be used, resulting in high maintenance costs. Key-person dependencies could also develop, leaving the NMHS with a significant and costly issue to resolve, particularly if the key person leaves the organization and the CDMS ceases to operate.
3. CDMS component solutions could be developed that do not effectively use NMHS climate data, for example:
    1. Data may be replicated from the climate database and made into stand-alone files to support a particular technology or due to the developer’s lack of experience. Whereas the data in the climate database are subject to a lengthy quality assurance lifecycle and may change, the replicated data are fixed at a point in time and may not be updated to reflect later changes to the climate record. This may become a significant issue for the NMHS, particularly if this practice is systematically applied by many developers, across many applications and over many years.
    2. The data extraction process may not take into account quality assurance flags and just present raw observations with no indication of data quality or reliability.
    3. Developers may not understand the complexities of the climate database data model and extract incorrect data.
    4. Components may have any number of data inconsistency or misuse issues. What is the impact on the reputation of the NMHS if the same data are presented with differing values by different CDMS components?</p>
<p>There may also be architectural considerations that are better off understood early in the CDMS development so that governance processes can ensure that the considerations are implemented within developed and/or implemented software.</p>
<p>One issue to consider is whether the CDMS should be able to work in multiple languages. The answer to this will have implications for the design of software for the user interface of CDMS components, as well as for the generation and presentation of data products.</p>
<p>IT architecture is a specialized field of information technology that is typically undertaken by highly experienced professionals with very broad IT experience. Ideally, this task will be conducted by experienced NMHS staff to ensure that consistent CDMS components are implemented in accordance with a strategic vision.</p>

                                <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">In order to share climate data between organizations or make meaningful comparisons between information from datasets provided by different publishers, it is highly recommended that climate data conform to a logical data model.

A logical data model describes the content and structure of information resources at an abstract level. When implemented in a CDMS, the logical data model underpins the design of the information objects managed by the system and helps to determine the questions that one may ask of the system when querying those information objects and their interrelationships.

Furthermore, the logical data model may be used as the basis for developing data formats within which the information objects can be serialized for exchange between systems – thus ensuring interoperability between those systems.

WMO is currently developing a logical data model termed the Modèle pour l’ Échange des informations sur le Temps, le Climat et l’Eau2 (METCE), which is intended to provide a basis for application-specific data models, including those used for climate observing and climate data management.

Ideally, the underlying database structure will be based on the logical data model.</div>

More advanced CDMSs may manage the data in a series of related databases rather than in a single database.

It is recommended that the climate database provide support for the following functionalities, classified by priority:

**Required**
1. Managing core observations described in the Guide to Climatological Practices (WMO-No. 100).
2. Managing observation metadata (such as station metadata) and integrating them with observations data.
3. Handling observations from multiple sensors per station, per phenomenon, and recording the source of each observation.
4. Managing multiple tiers of data quality, from raw records to homogenized data.
5. Managing spatial and time-series data.

**Recommended**

6. Covering at least the GCOS ECVs.
7. Using a robust data model that takes into account the requirements of open spatial standards, particularly the ISO 19156:2011 Geographic information – Observations and measurements standard, METCE and the WMO climate observations application schema (see component 4.2.3.2).
8. Managing metadata related to data provenance. This entails ensuring that each change to an observation is recorded for future recovery, and recording the details of why a particular change was made, which includes:
    1. Tracing the product lineage to the data source. For example, what observations and gridded data were used to underpin the analysis released in peer-reviewed paper X?
    2. Ensuring that the reason for each observation change is recorded.
9. Managing third-party and crowdsourced data.
10. Managing intellectual property rights related to data.
11. Enabling point-in-time recovery. For example, what data were present in the database for station X at time T?
12. Storing a range of document formats, such as:
    1. Photographs of observation stations and instruments, meteorological phenomena, etc.
    2. Scanned paper observation forms
    3. Scanned microfiche/microfilm
    4. Relevant observations metadata documents, such as instrument calibration reports
    5. Technical manuals
    6. Site location plans and sections
    7. Videos and other multimedia formats

Optional

13. Handling data uncertainty (for more information, see Wikipedia articles on uncertain data and uncertainty).
14. Managing multidimensional time-series gridded data and possibly numerical models.
15. Providing support for the information management concepts of semantics and linked data.</div>

<p>In essence, the ISO 19156:2011 <em>Geographic information – Observations and measurements</em> standard treats an observation as an event at a given point in time whose result is an estimate of the value of some property of a feature of interest, obtained using a known observation procedure.</p>
<p>This standard is being widely adopted as the framework for a number of logical data models related to observations data, such as WaterML and the Meteorological Information Exchange Model of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).</p>
<p>It also underpins current work on the WMO logical data model called METCE (see below).</p>

<p>METCE is an application schema conforming to ISO 19109:2005 <em>Geographic information – Rules for application schema</em>. Furthermore, METCE is a profile of the Observations and measurements standard that provides domain- and application specific semantics for use within the weather, water and climate domains.</p>
<p>The initial iteration of METCE and its companion model, the Observable Property Model, were developed by the Task Team on Aviation XML to support the ICAO Meteorological Information Exchange Model.</p>
<p>However, METCE will provide a common semantic basis for a growing number of data products relating to observation and simulation within WMO. Not only will this simplify the requirements for software systems working with WMO products, it is also expected to simplify the mappings between WMO data products and counterparts from other communities such as CF-netCDF.</p>
<p>As at December 2013, plans have been made to provide mappings/rules to convert from the METCE application schema to BUFR sequences and/or GRIB templates at some point in the future.</p>

                                <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The term climate metadata is defined in this publication as the suite of supporting data required
to effectively manage climate data and assess the data’s fitness for purpose.
Climate metadata are made up of the following components:
Observations metadata Time-series data that describe how, when and where
meteorological observations were made and the conditions they
were made under.
Discovery metadata Information intended to facilitate the discovery and assessment
of a dataset to determine if it is fit for reuse for a purpose that
may be at odds with the reason for which it was originally
created.
Data provenance metadata Information relevant to climate data that allows end-users,
including data managers, scientists and the general public, to
develop trust in the integrity of the climate data.
The following section expands on each component of climate metadata.</div>

                                        <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This subsection covers access to and management of station metadata and platform metadata.

Station and platform metadata are time-series data that describe how, when and where meteorological observations were made and the conditions they were made under. They are used to support a range of activities that allow climate professionals to understand the fitness for purpose of specific data and, in many cases, improve the quality of climate observations data. This type of metadata is referred to as observations metadata in this publication.

It is anticipated that application schemas (also known as logical data models) will be developed to formally define the structure and content of the information required to describe climate observing stations, sensors and platforms (see the Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2))

Note: As a general rule, it will be necessary to record and maintain the details of any change to observations metadata in order to understand the context surrounding specific climate data and to support future data homogenization activities. In addition to details of the change, specific reference must be made to:
1. The date/time of the change - Note: It may not always be possible to define the exact date of the change, for example when a change happens between two site visits. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to include a period of time during which the change occurred.
2. The reason the change was made.
3. The beginning and end dates of the prior value.
4. Any date/time reference will need to be constrained by the appropriate temporal datum to ensure that date handling is consistently applied.

<p>As discussed in the Sensor component below (4.3.1.7), recording the location of each sensor at the station is also mandatory.</p>
<p>The following information is required:
1. Latitude
2. Longitude
3. Elevation
4. Spatial reference system (horizontal and vertical)
5. Date/time of the survey observation used to record the location of the station and/or sensor
6. Temporal reference system
7. Method used to determine the location of the station
8. Positional accuracy of location
9. Date/time the station or sensor moved, together with previous locations
10. Administrative boundaries within which the station is located (as required by the NMHS)
11. Time zone</p>
<p>In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to move a station and keep the same station identifier. This should only be done in accordance with future global climate data policies and data governance processes (see recommendation 11.1 of this publication). Typically, this will involve parallel observations at the old and new station over a period of time (two years, for example).</p>
<p>If this is necessary, the time of the move should be recorded, together with current and past location details.</p>
<p>The precision required for the latitude, longitude and elevation should be in accordance with guidance provided by the Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observation.</p>
<p>While not authoritative, the final report of the first session of the Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observation Expert Team on Standardization suggests that the precision required for latitude and longitude measurements is one second (of arc), which equates to approximately 30 meters at the equator. This degree of precision should be achievable using a survey observation process that uses handheld GPS techniques.</p>
<p>Administrative boundaries may refer to different types of boundaries that contain the station, including:
i. Political boundaries, such as state, regional or district boundaries
ii. Administrative boundaries, such as the forecast district
iii. Natural boundaries, such as hydrological, catchment or topographic areas</p>

Discovery metadata are intended to facilitate the discovery and assessment of a spatial dataset to determine if it is fit for reuse for a purpose that may be at odds with the reason for which it was originally created.

Discovery metadata may also be known as WIS metadata. They are not the same as the observations metadata described above.

Note that some of the components below may be in addition to the WMO Core Profile of the ISO 19115 *Geographic information – Metadata* standard. This is not expected to be an issue as the WMO Core Profile does not restrict the use of additional ISO 19115 records.

                                        <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This subsection refers to the processes, data and governance arrangements that record and manage information relevant to climate data and enable end-users, including data managers, scientists and the general public, to develop trust in the integrity of the climate data.

Data provenance allows an end-user to understand the history of each piece of data, and thus helps the user to identify what version of the data was available at any given time. The need for this new type of climate metadata has become more evident following a number of attacks on the credibility of climate data. One notable example is the so-called Climategate
incident and subsequent inquiries.

Therefore, it is important for NMHSs to establish the reliability of their climate data and processes and to ensure that these data are subsequently seen as the authoritative source that can be used for global climate studies.

While the concept of data provenance has been relatively nebulous within the information management domain for many years, there has been a significant amount of work on the concept within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for over more than a decade, particularly with regard to the development of the PROV standard.

The W3C defines provenance as:
&gt; [A] record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing,
&gt; influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information
&gt; is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with
&gt; other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In
&gt; an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often
&gt; contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.
&gt; (W3C, 2013a)

While this work is still relatively new, it is showing significant potential for use within the climate domain.

The concepts presented here for climate data provenance are quite embryonic and need further work to ensure that they can be implemented effectively. See the related recommendation in Chapter 11.

Maintaining a dataset with high levels of data provenance metadata is expected to be quite expensive and, as a result, will be limited to data of high importance such as high-quality climate monitoring datasets. It is anticipated that guidance will be required to suggest what data should be maintained with what level of data provenance metadata. This guidance could perhaps be included as a policy within a future climate data framework.

<p>See Wright (2012a) for a description of a recommended change in the method of calculating
climatological standard normals.</p>
<p>The approach is understood to comprise the following. (However, as at December 2013 this has
yet to be officially endorsed.)
1. A fixed reference period (1961–1990) for longterm climate variability and change assessment. This is to be adopted as a stable WMO reference period, until such time as there is a compelling scientific case for changing it.
2. A varying 30-year period updated every 10 years (suitable for most climate services). The current period is 1981–2010.</p>

The Commission for Climatology/Climate Variability and Predictability (CCl/CLIVAR) Working Group on Climate Change Detection has been coordinating an international effort to develop, calculate and analyse a suite of indices so that individuals, countries and regions can calculate the indices in exactly the same way such that their analyses will fit seamlessly into the global picture.

Those indices have been split in two categories: core indices and approved indices.

<p>Some examples are:
1. Climate models (such as global climate models) - numerical representations of the climate system based on physical, biological and chemical rules. They vary on timescales ranging from seasonal to centennial. Climate models are often used to produce climate change projections.
2. Downscaled models – derived from climate models but at a much higher resolution to support regional and local analysis.
3. Reanalysis - designed for climate studies, reanalyses provide gridded data over a long time period. Reanalyses are created via an unchanging (frozen) data assimilation scheme and model(s) which ingest all available observations. This unchanging framework provides a dynamically consistent estimate of the climate state at each time step. Some available reanalysis products include ERA-40 (40 years) and ERA-Interim (1979 to the present) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis project (1871–2011) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, United States.
4. Numerical weather prediction</p>

                                        <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">As discussed in the article by the UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee (2011), one of the recommendations of the UK parliamentary review of the Climategate issue was to ensure that climate scientists make available the full methodological workings (including computer codes) used to support their work. An extract is reproduced below.

&gt; It is not standard practice in climate science to publish the raw data and the computer code in academic papers. However, climate science is a matter of great importance and the quality of the science should be irreproachable. We therefore consider that climate scientists should take steps to make available all the data that support their work (including raw data) and full methodological workings (including the computer codes).

This has implications for the effective management of climate data and software in that software source code will also require careful management.

In addition, it will be necessary to keep track of the time period during which each software version is in operation, as this may also have implications for climate data and climate analysis.

On a conceptual level, this is similar in a way to the need to have effective observations metadata that describe the maintenance of sensors and stations.</div>

1. Action required when new phenomena are to be ingested but a record already exists in the
database for that time period.
    1. Should the new record replace the current record in the database or should the new record be rejected?</p>
<pre><code>    There is potential for data that have not been quality controlled to overwrite perfectly good quality-controlled data. An example is a message that is reingested and the ingest process does not take into account the possibility that the data already exist in the database and that they have been modified.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Action required when a message arrives for ingest but the message type is not appropriate according to the observations metadata on record for that station.</li>
<li>Action required should a message arrive containing an observed value that is outside the accepted bounds for a given phenomenon. For example, a message contains a value of 90°C for temperature, where the maximum accepted temperature is 60°C.</li>
<li>Action required should a message arrive that is of a lower order of precedence to one that has already been ingested for the same time period and station. For example:<ol>
<li>The priority level given to records being ingested may relate to the method of data acquisition. A record that has been keyed in via a quality assurance process may be given a higher priority than a record acquired via a real-time message ingest.</li>

Typically, this functionality is tightly controlled according to NMHS data governance processes.

Some issues to consider are:
1. Data entry staff should only be able to add data to or edit data in the climate database under programme control, with appropriate safeguards in place to protect the integrity of the climate database.
2. Any functionality that provides write access to the database should also include an audit function to allow an independent review of database changes - One example could be the use of database triggers that write the details of a transaction,
including the previous values, into a separate set of audit tables.
3. Another approach could be to ensure that the data entry process creates an interim data file that is then entered into the database via data ingest processes, bypassing the need for direct access to the database.
4. NMHS data policy may enforce the need for double entry practices, where two or more operators key in data for the same form, independent of each other, to detect and minimize key-in errors.
5. Careful consideration should be made to ensure that an organization has very effective IT security and monitoring in place prior to allowing key-in access via the Internet. Most organizations will not have suitable controls in place. Therefore, key-in via the Internet should be avoided as a general rule.
6. NMHS data policy should provide guidelines as to appropriate data quality considerations applied to data that are manually entered.</div>

3. The mapping of fields in the form with appropriate records and tables within the climate database.
4. Ensuring that the integrity of the climate database is protected by validating data before they are added to the database.</p>
<p>The component should also support:</p>
<ol>
<li>A custom definition of user input forms that mimic traditional meteorological forms (including the language where appropriate).</li>

<p>This will facilitate:
1. Future analysis that requires data of a specific quality flag value.
2. Communication on the assessed quality of records.</p>
<p>The best description to date on how to define this classification may be found in the <em>Guide to Climatological Practices</em> (WMO-No. 100), pp. 3–8 to 3–9. This reference describes a way of flagging quality based on a combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data type (original, corrected, reconstructed or calculated)</li>
<li>Validation stage</li>
<li>Acquisition method</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach is still quite limited. It does not provide a clear way of determining just what level of quality control a record has been subjected to.</p>
<p>While the classifications are relevant and relate to the perceived quality of a record, they do not allow for an explicit comparison of data of similar perceived quality.</p>
<p>For example, the subsection on quality management (5.3.1) describes a series of classifications of tests (without providing actual details). If a record has passed all such tests, can it be considered to be better quality than one that has not passed any test?</p>
<p>Objective quality classifications are required to support a consistent approach within the global WMO community so that data can be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Objectively compared to ensure that data of similar quality can be compared and analysed as required.</li>
<li>Stored and easily retrieved from a climate database. It is becoming increasingly apparent that organizations will need to retain observations at multiple levels of quality from the raw observation through various edit and analysis processes in order to demonstrate the true lineage of a record and explain and justify the changes made to the raw observations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: A more objective approach to determining this classification for the global WMO community is required.</p>

<p>Note: This index has yet to be created. For the purposes of this publication, it is called the climate observation quality classification. However, this name may change. It is envisioned that this index will need to take into account a number of factors, including:
1. Siting classification
2. Sustained performance classification
3. Regular maintenance and calibration of sensor
4. Sensor reliability
5. Uncertainty inherent in observations
6. Observation quality control processes
7. Multilayer quality flags
8. Lineage
9. Homogeneity
10. Other appropriate factors</p>

<p>There are many factors that can influence the quality of derived data. Some issues to consider are:
1. What is the quality of the source data?
2. What algorithms have been applied to the source data to arrive at the derived data?
3. What is the impact of these algorithms on the quality of the derived data?
4. If the derived dataset is spatial, how has the positional location of the data been derived?
    1. What is the quality of the source spatial data?
    2. What is the impact of the algorithms used to spatially distribute the data on the positional accuracy of the derived data?</p>

As noted in the OGC Abstract Specification: Geographic Information – Observations and measurements (p. 13), all observations have an element of uncertainty:

&gt; The observation error typically has a systematic component, which is similar for all estimates made using the same procedure, and a random component, associated with the particular application instance of the observation procedure. If potential errors in a property value are important in the context of a data analysis or processing application, then the details of the act of observation which provided the estimate of the value are required.

This functionality will support:
1. Future statistical analysis that takes into account the uncertainty inherent in data.
2. Communication of data uncertainty.

Note: This subsection is deliberately kept generic in this version of the CDMS Specifications, with all types of climate metadata bundled together. While the Create and Maintain components (5.5.1.1 and 5.5.1.2, respectively) are classified as recommended, in reality data provenance metadata has not yet been adequately defined. Therefore, a pragmatic approach would rightly not address the creation and maintenance of data provenance metadata until this has been rectified. The creation and maintenance of discovery and observations metadata, however, is required.

<p>A Wikipedia article defines general circulation models as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[A] mathematical model of the general circulation of a planetary atmosphere or ocean and based on the Navier–Stokes equations on a rotating sphere with thermodynamic terms for various energy sources (radiation, latent heat). These equations are the basis for complex computer programs commonly used for simulating the atmosphere or ocean of the Earth. Atmospheric and oceanic GCMs (AGCM and OGCM) are key components of <strong>global climate models</strong> along with sea ice and land-surface components. GCMs and global climate models are widely applied for weather forecasting, understanding the climate, and projecting climate change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such climate numerical models could be global in scale (like GCMs) but they could also be regional, with generally a higher precision.</p>
<p>Downscaling techniques are often used when creating regional models.</p>
<p>Models can be based on:
1. The rules of physics, biology and chemistry
2. Statistical rules
3. A mix of dynamic and statistic methods</p>
<p>The use of climate models includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simulation of the present climate</li>
<li>Simulation of the future climate</li>
<li>Palaeoclimate reconstruction</li>
<li>Seasonal forecasts</li>
<li>Decadal prediction</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Most NMHSs would not have the resources needed to effectively manage the infrastructure and software required to support this component. However, the data output from such components may be useful and should be available for NMHSs via a number of sources, including Regional Climate Centres.</p>

1. Determining what observations data are available based on a set of parameters and viewing the results in a table. These parameters may include:
    1. Station
    2. Sensor or procedure
    3.  Phenomena
    4.  Data quality (based on quality flags, the climate observation quality classification or other method)
    5.  Time period
    6.  A variety of other observation metadata parameters
2. Reviewing observations metadata for selected stations.
3. Determining what datasets provide the actual observations data for a given station, sensor and phenomenon combination, together with the URL of the relevant discovery metadata records. The discovery metadata records will in turn provide the URLs of any services providing dynamic access to the data. An example could involve searching for stations that use both a tipping bucket raingauge and manual methods to observe rainfall.</p>

                                <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This section has been included because open spatial standards are seen as a mechanism that is being increasingly adopted by many organizations and industry sectors around the world. These types of services underpin global attempts at making data easily accessible through initiatives such as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) (see GEOSS web page). The WMO Information System can be considered as a component of GEOSS.

Open spatial standards are being increasingly supported by a wide range of off-the-shelf software, including traditional desktop GIS software, making it easier for users to access data that are served via such services.

This is particularly important for CDMSs, as there is a large potential user base that does not routinely use climate data but could benefit from having a reliable source from which to take the data to ensure consistent use across industry. Some examples of growing interest in climate data can be found in sectors such as agriculture, emergency services, aquaculture, fishing, tourism, transportation, health and environment. Such industries typically do not understand WMO data formats such as BUFR or GRIB, nor do they understand how to exploit data delivered in such formats.

While developing countries may not have reliable access to the Internet to take advantage of external open spatial services, it would certainly be possible to use them within their own internal local area networks, particularly as a means to visualize their data.

In short, open spatial standards are expected to become an increasingly important mechanism for distributing data in future years.

Note: The open spatial components presented below are indicative of the types of standards and services that are available and appropriate for the delivery of climate data. These components are not intended to be exhaustive as there are many more services and standards that are also relevant. It is anticipated that this will be expanded upon in future revisions of this publication.

                                        <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Application schemas (as defined in ISO 19109:2005 Geographic information – Rules for application schema) provide an abstract representation of the content and structure of information resources. The Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2) outlines the use of application schemas specifically developed for the climate domain.

These abstract representations of information provide the basis for deriving concrete encodings or data formats that allow the information to be serialized for exchange between systems and organizations.

Work is proceeding within WMO to harmonize existing TDCFs (FM 92 GRIB Edition 2 and FM 94 BUFR Edition 4) with WMO METCE (described in the METCE component (4.2.3.1)), with the intent to bind those existing data formats to explicit, well-understood semantics.

In addition, the application schema can be used to develop XML-based data encodings using widely supported open standards for geographic information. The ISO 19136:2007 Geographic information – Geography Markup Language (GML) standard provides rules for serializing the abstract data model expressed as an application schema via XML encoding to create a GML
application schema.

In summary:
1. An application schema can be thought of as a logical data model. For more information, see the subsection on WMO logical data models (4.2.3).
2. A GML application schema is a physical model that is derived from a logical data model published using a particular technology - which in this case is GML. For an example, see the Combined climate observations and metadata component (8.1.2.1) below.

Deriving a GML application schema from an application schema developed specifically for the climate domain (see Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2)) is anticipated to make climate data far more readily consumable for a broader community of users such as those interested in determining the impacts of climate change.

While work has been conducted for several years, this task is still in its early stages as at December 2013. It is expected to take a number of years to complete. For an overview of how a logical data model (and associated application schema) could be used
with climate data, see Bannerman (2012), pp. 20–26.

For a more detailed description of what has been done to date, see Tandy (2013a), which provides an overview of the direction that WMO logical data model work is taking with regard to METCE.</div>

<p>Following the work of the Task Team on Aviation XML, WMO has established the WMO Codes Registry, which provides a web-based publication of terms from the Manual on Codes (WMO-No. 306).</p>
<p>The current coverage of terms is sparse - only covering the aviation-related terms required by the sponsoring activity - but there is commitment from WMO to populate the remaining code tables.</p>
<p>The WMO Codes Registry provides a well-defined programmatic application programming interface (API) alongside the web application. Where the need arises for publication of locally managed terms, it is recommended that the registry API be supported.</p>
<p>An open-source reference implementation of the registry software is available.</p>
