If potential errors in a property value are important in the context of a data analysis or processing application, then the details of the act of observation which provided the estimate of the value are required.\n\nThis functionality will support:\n1. Future statistical analysis that takes into account the uncertainty inherent in data.\n2. Communication of data uncertainty.\n\nFor more information, see Wikipedia articles on:\na) Uncertain data\nb) Uncertainty",

Some examples are:\n1. Uncertainty inherent in the source observations data.\n2. Uncertainty inherent in the location of sensors/stations used to generate the grids.\n3. The relative accuracy of the algorithms used to generate the derived data.\n4. The precision of variable data types used in the software that generates derived data.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a number of these factors may propagate through the data derivation process.",
