                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This subsection refers to the processes, software, governance processes and data analysis used to understand and record the uncertainty inherent in the data.

As noted in the OGC Abstract Specification: Geographic Information â€“ Observations and measurements (p. 13), all observations have an element of uncertainty:

&gt; The observation error typically has a systematic component, which is similar for all estimates made using the same procedure, and a random component, associated with the particular application instance of the observation procedure. If potential errors in a property value are important in the context of a data analysis or processing application, then the details of the act of observation which provided the estimate of the value are required.

This functionality will support:
1. Future statistical analysis that takes into account the uncertainty inherent in data.
2. Communication of data uncertainty.

                    <p>This component refers to the processes, software, governance mechanisms and data analysis used to understand and record the uncertainty inherent in gridded data that have been derived from observation data.</p>
<p>Many factors can contribute to the uncertainty inherent in gridded derived data. Some examples are:
1. Uncertainty inherent in the source observations data.
2. Uncertainty inherent in the location of sensors/stations used to generate the grids.
3. The relative accuracy of the algorithms used to generate the derived data.
4. The precision of variable data types used in the software that generates derived data.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that a number of these factors may propagate through the data derivation process.</p>
