  "text": "This collection of components refers to the overall governance of information technology to ensure that effective CDMSs are developed, enhanced and maintained.\n\nWhile these components are specifically aimed at larger organizations with a substantial investment in information and communication technology, smaller organizations can also benefit from investment in the types of issues discussed.\n\nThese components are also relevant to broader initiatives, such as when an aid or development agency sponsors CDMS development and implementation.\n\nThese issues will only be discussed very briefly, as each component refers to a substantial body of knowledge that will require ongoing investment from specialists to ensure effective management of resources and funds for information and communication technology.",
