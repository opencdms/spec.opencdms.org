  "text": "This component represents technology suitable for the distribution of a broad range of vector climate data via a Web Feature Service (WFS).\n\nIn essence, a WFS could provide vector and tabular climate data, which could be presented in a number of formats such as GML (see OGC GML web page) or Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) shapefile.\n\nSome WFS implementations can serve data constrained by a logical data model (also known as an application schema). It may also be possible to enable WFS server software to provide meteorological observation data via WMO formats such as BUFR.\n\nThere may be issues with serving time series via WFS. There is discussion that a Sensor Web Service may be better for time-series\nobservations.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) OGC WFS documentation",
