  "text": "This component covers the recording of details relating to the location of the station or observation platform.\n\nAs discussed in the Sensor component below (4.3.1.7), recording the location of each sensor at the station is also mandatory.\n\nThe following information is required:\n1. Latitude\n2. Longitude\n3. Elevation\n4. Spatial reference system (horizontal and vertical)\n5. Date/time of the survey observation used to record the location of the station and/or sensor\n6. Temporal reference system\n7. Method used to determine the location of the station\n8. Positional accuracy of location\n9. Date/time the station or sensor moved, together with previous locations\n10. Administrative boundaries within which the station is located (as required by the NMHS)\n11. Time zone\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to move a station and keep the same station identifier. This should only be done in accordance with future global climate data policies and data governance processes (see recommendation 11.1 of this publication). Typically, this will involve parallel observations at the old and new station over a period of time (two years, for example).\n\nIf this is necessary, the time of the move should be recorded, together with current and past location details.\n\nThe precision required for the latitude, longitude and elevation should be in accordance with guidance provided by the Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observation.\n\nWhile not authoritative, the final report of the first session of the Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observation Expert Team on Standardization suggests that the precision required for latitude and longitude measurements is one second (of arc), which equates to approximately 30 meters at the equator. This degree of precision should be achievable using a survey observation process that uses handheld GPS techniques.\n\nAdministrative boundaries may refer to different types of boundaries that contain the station, including:\ni. Political boundaries, such as state, regional or district boundaries\nii. Administrative boundaries, such as the forecast district\niii. Natural boundaries, such as hydrological, catchment or topographic areas\n\nFor more information, see:\na) ISO 19111-2:2009 *Geographic information \u2013 Spatial referencing by coordinates, Part 2: Extension for parametric values*\nb) *Guide to Meteorological Instruments and Methods of Observation* (WMO-No. 8), section 1.3.3.2 Coordinates of the station. Specifically note the instructions on determining the elevation of a station relative to the raingauge.\nc) OGC Abstract Specification: Spatial referencing by coordinates",
