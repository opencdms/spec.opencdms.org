A manual investigation may then assess the validity of the suspect values.\n\nSome examples are problems typically caused by:\n1. Inexperienced operators.\n2. Instruments that are not or are incorrectly calibrated.\n3. Operator behaviour or organizational policy, for example not recording rainfall data over a weekend period and aggregating the results on the following Monday.\n4. Known deficiencies in observers handling data such as evaporation-related observations.\n5. Changes over time caused by changes at an observation site. For example, a shift in the magnitude of wind recorded from a specific direction may be an indicator of a problem at the site location, such as a new building structure or trees obstructing the flow of the wind in that direction.",

Climate tests that highlight extreme climatic values, such as a record maximum air temperature.\n2. Flatline tests where a constant value exceeds the specified limit in a time series, for example when the station air temperature remains constant for 12 hours.\n3. Spike tests conducted in a time series to identify data spikes exceeding a specified limit, for example when a three-hourly air temperature observation is at least 50 degrees colder than all others during the day.\n4. Rapid change tests conducted in a time series to identify rapid changes exceeding a specified limit, for example when a 100 cm soil temperature suddenly changes in consecutive 3-hourly observations from a relatively stable 22\u00b0C to 38\u00b0C for all following observations.",
