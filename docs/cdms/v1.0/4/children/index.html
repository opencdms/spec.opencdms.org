                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">In order to share climate data between organizations or make meaningful comparisons between information from datasets provided by different publishers, it is highly recommended that climate data conform to a logical data model.

A logical data model describes the content and structure of information resources at an abstract level. When implemented in a CDMS, the logical data model underpins the design of the information objects managed by the system and helps to determine the questions that one may ask of the system when querying those information objects and their interrelationships.

Furthermore, the logical data model may be used as the basis for developing data formats within which the information objects can be serialized for exchange between systems – thus ensuring interoperability between those systems.

WMO is currently developing a logical data model termed the Modèle pour l’ Échange des informations sur le Temps, le Climat et l’Eau2 (METCE), which is intended to provide a basis for application-specific data models, including those used for climate observing and climate data management.

Ideally, the underlying database structure will be based on the logical data model.</div>

                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This subsection refers to the database(s) used to store and manage a range of time-series data, including: climate observations, climate metadata (observations, discovery and data provenance), spatial information, derived data and related data required for effective data management.

More advanced CDMSs may manage the data in a series of related databases rather than in a single database.

It is recommended that the climate database provide support for the following functionalities, classified by priority:

**Required**
1. Managing core observations described in the Guide to Climatological Practices (WMO-No. 100).
2. Managing observation metadata (such as station metadata) and integrating them with observations data.
3. Handling observations from multiple sensors per station, per phenomenon, and recording the source of each observation.
4. Managing multiple tiers of data quality, from raw records to homogenized data.
5. Managing spatial and time-series data.

**Recommended**

6. Covering at least the GCOS ECVs.
7. Using a robust data model that takes into account the requirements of open spatial standards, particularly the ISO 19156:2011 Geographic information – Observations and measurements standard, METCE and the WMO climate observations application schema (see component 4.2.3.2).
8. Managing metadata related to data provenance. This entails ensuring that each change to an observation is recorded for future recovery, and recording the details of why a particular change was made, which includes:
    1. Tracing the product lineage to the data source. For example, what observations and gridded data were used to underpin the analysis released in peer-reviewed paper X?
    2. Ensuring that the reason for each observation change is recorded.
9. Managing third-party and crowdsourced data.
10. Managing intellectual property rights related to data.
11. Enabling point-in-time recovery. For example, what data were present in the database for station X at time T?
12. Storing a range of document formats, such as:
    1. Photographs of observation stations and instruments, meteorological phenomena, etc.
    2. Scanned paper observation forms
    3. Scanned microfiche/microfilm
    4. Relevant observations metadata documents, such as instrument calibration reports
    5. Technical manuals
    6. Site location plans and sections
    7. Videos and other multimedia formats

Optional

13. Handling data uncertainty (for more information, see Wikipedia articles on uncertain data and uncertainty).
14. Managing multidimensional time-series gridded data and possibly numerical models.
15. Providing support for the information management concepts of semantics and linked data.</div>

Furthermore, METCE is a profile of the Observations and measurements standard that provides domain- and application specific semantics for use within the weather, water and climate domains.</p>
<p>The initial iteration of METCE and its companion model, the Observable Property Model, were developed by the Task Team on Aviation XML to support the ICAO Meteorological Information Exchange Model.</p>
<p>However, METCE will provide a common semantic basis for a growing number of data products relating to observation and simulation within WMO. Not only will this simplify the requirements for software systems working with WMO products, it is also expected to simplify the mappings between WMO data products and counterparts from other communities such as CF-netCDF.</p>
<p>As at December 2013, plans have been made to provide mappings/rules to convert from the METCE application schema to BUFR sequences and/or GRIB templates at some point in the future.</p>

                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">The term climate metadata is defined in this publication as the suite of supporting data required
to effectively manage climate data and assess the data’s fitness for purpose.
Climate metadata are made up of the following components:
Observations metadata Time-series data that describe how, when and where
meteorological observations were made and the conditions they
were made under.
Discovery metadata Information intended to facilitate the discovery and assessment
of a dataset to determine if it is fit for reuse for a purpose that
may be at odds with the reason for which it was originally
created.
Data provenance metadata Information relevant to climate data that allows end-users,
including data managers, scientists and the general public, to
develop trust in the integrity of the climate data.
The following section expands on each component of climate metadata.</div>

                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This subsection covers access to and management of station metadata and platform metadata.

Station and platform metadata are time-series data that describe how, when and where meteorological observations were made and the conditions they were made under. They are used to support a range of activities that allow climate professionals to understand the fitness for purpose of specific data and, in many cases, improve the quality of climate observations data. This type of metadata is referred to as observations metadata in this publication.

It is anticipated that application schemas (also known as logical data models) will be developed to formally define the structure and content of the information required to describe climate observing stations, sensors and platforms (see the Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2))

Note: As a general rule, it will be necessary to record and maintain the details of any change to observations metadata in order to understand the context surrounding specific climate data and to support future data homogenization activities. In addition to details of the change, specific reference must be made to:
1. The date/time of the change - Note: It may not always be possible to define the exact date of the change, for example when a change happens between two site visits. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to include a period of time during which the change occurred.
2. The reason the change was made.
3. The beginning and end dates of the prior value.
4. Any date/time reference will need to be constrained by the appropriate temporal datum to ensure that date handling is consistently applied.

                    <p>This component covers the recording of details relating to the location of the station or observation platform.</p>
<p>As discussed in the Sensor component below (4.3.1.7), recording the location of each sensor at the station is also mandatory.</p>
<p>The following information is required:
1. Latitude
2. Longitude
3. Elevation
4. Spatial reference system (horizontal and vertical)
5. Date/time of the survey observation used to record the location of the station and/or sensor
6. Temporal reference system
7. Method used to determine the location of the station
8. Positional accuracy of location
9. Date/time the station or sensor moved, together with previous locations
10. Administrative boundaries within which the station is located (as required by the NMHS)
11. Time zone</p>
<p>In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to move a station and keep the same station identifier. This should only be done in accordance with future global climate data policies and data governance processes (see recommendation 11.1 of this publication). Typically, this will involve parallel observations at the old and new station over a period of time (two years, for example).</p>
<p>If this is necessary, the time of the move should be recorded, together with current and past location details.</p>
<p>The precision required for the latitude, longitude and elevation should be in accordance with guidance provided by the Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observation.</p>
<p>While not authoritative, the final report of the first session of the Commission for Instruments and Methods of Observation Expert Team on Standardization suggests that the precision required for latitude and longitude measurements is one second (of arc), which equates to approximately 30 meters at the equator. This degree of precision should be achievable using a survey observation process that uses handheld GPS techniques.</p>
<p>Administrative boundaries may refer to different types of boundaries that contain the station, including:
i. Political boundaries, such as state, regional or district boundaries
ii. Administrative boundaries, such as the forecast district
iii. Natural boundaries, such as hydrological, catchment or topographic areas</p>

Discovery metadata are intended to facilitate the discovery and assessment of a spatial dataset to determine if it is fit for reuse for a purpose that may be at odds with the reason for which it was originally created.

Discovery metadata may also be known as WIS metadata. They are not the same as the observations metadata described above.

Note that some of the components below may be in addition to the WMO Core Profile of the ISO 19115 *Geographic information – Metadata* standard. This is not expected to be an issue as the WMO Core Profile does not restrict the use of additional ISO 19115 records.

                    </h4>
                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">This subsection refers to the processes, data and governance arrangements that record and manage information relevant to climate data and enable end-users, including data managers, scientists and the general public, to develop trust in the integrity of the climate data.

Data provenance allows an end-user to understand the history of each piece of data, and thus helps the user to identify what version of the data was available at any given time. The need for this new type of climate metadata has become more evident following a number of attacks on the credibility of climate data. One notable example is the so-called Climategate
incident and subsequent inquiries.

Therefore, it is important for NMHSs to establish the reliability of their climate data and processes and to ensure that these data are subsequently seen as the authoritative source that can be used for global climate studies.

While the concept of data provenance has been relatively nebulous within the information management domain for many years, there has been a significant amount of work on the concept within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for over more than a decade, particularly with regard to the development of the PROV standard.

The W3C defines provenance as:
&gt; [A] record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing,
&gt; influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information
&gt; is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with
&gt; other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In
&gt; an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often
&gt; contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.
&gt; (W3C, 2013a)

While this work is still relatively new, it is showing significant potential for use within the climate domain.

The concepts presented here for climate data provenance are quite embryonic and need further work to ensure that they can be implemented effectively. See the related recommendation in Chapter 11.

Maintaining a dataset with high levels of data provenance metadata is expected to be quite expensive and, as a result, will be limited to data of high importance such as high-quality climate monitoring datasets. It is anticipated that guidance will be required to suggest what data should be maintained with what level of data provenance metadata. This guidance could perhaps be included as a policy within a future climate data framework.

<p>The approach is understood to comprise the following. (However, as at December 2013 this has
yet to be officially endorsed.)
1. A fixed reference period (1961–1990) for longterm climate variability and change assessment. This is to be adopted as a stable WMO reference period, until such time as there is a compelling scientific case for changing it.
2. A varying 30-year period updated every 10 years (suitable for most climate services). The current period is 1981–2010.</p>

<p>Some examples are:
1. Climate models (such as global climate models) - numerical representations of the climate system based on physical, biological and chemical rules. They vary on timescales ranging from seasonal to centennial. Climate models are often used to produce climate change projections.
2. Downscaled models – derived from climate models but at a much higher resolution to support regional and local analysis.
3. Reanalysis - designed for climate studies, reanalyses provide gridded data over a long time period. Reanalyses are created via an unchanging (frozen) data assimilation scheme and model(s) which ingest all available observations. This unchanging framework provides a dynamically consistent estimate of the climate state at each time step. Some available reanalysis products include ERA-40 (40 years) and ERA-Interim (1979 to the present) from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, and the Twentieth Century Reanalysis project (1871–2011) from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, United States.

                    </h4>
                    <div class="cdms-content" style="padding-bottom: 10px;">As discussed in the article by the UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee (2011), one of the recommendations of the UK parliamentary review of the Climategate issue was to ensure that climate scientists make available the full methodological workings (including computer codes) used to support their work. An extract is reproduced below.

&gt; It is not standard practice in climate science to publish the raw data and the computer code in academic papers. However, climate science is a matter of great importance and the quality of the science should be irreproachable. We therefore consider that climate scientists should take steps to make available all the data that support their work (including raw data) and full methodological workings (including the computer codes).

This has implications for the effective management of climate data and software in that software source code will also require careful management.

In addition, it will be necessary to keep track of the time period during which each software version is in operation, as this may also have implications for climate data and climate analysis.

On a conceptual level, this is similar in a way to the need to have effective observations metadata that describe the maintenance of sensors and stations.</div>
