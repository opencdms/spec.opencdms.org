The list below is not comprehensive and additional variables may be required or recommended.\n\nThe list is currently based on the ECVs published in 2010 by GCOS. However, it is worth noting that there are other types of variables that are very relevant to climate observation, such as visibility, evaporation and meteorological phenomena.\n\nObservations include measurements made by observers, traditional sensors and remote sensors.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) GCOS website\nb) GCOS web page on ECVS",
