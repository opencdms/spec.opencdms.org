  "text": "As discussed in the article by the UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee (2011), one of the recommendations of the UK parliamentary review of the Climategate issue was to ensure that climate scientists make available the full methodological workings (including computer codes) used to support their work. An extract is reproduced below.\n\n> It is not standard practice in climate science to publish the raw data and the computer code in academic papers. However, climate science is a matter of great importance and the quality of the science should be irreproachable. We therefore consider that climate scientists should take steps to make available all the data that support their work (including raw data) and full methodological workings (including the computer codes).\n\nThis has implications for the effective management of climate data and software in that software source code will also require careful management.\n\nIn addition, it will be necessary to keep track of the time period during which each software version is in operation, as this may also have implications for climate data and climate analysis.\n\nOn a conceptual level, this is similar in a way to the need to have effective observations metadata that describe the maintenance of sensors and stations.",
