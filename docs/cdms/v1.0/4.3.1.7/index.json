Sensor firmware, version and dates during which each version was used\n    10.  Length of time the observation data are stored locally on the sensor, prior to deletion\n2. Sensor installation details, including:\n    1. Technician and organization that installed the sensor\n    2.  Date sensor was installed\n3. Sensor status, including:\n    1. Operational status:\n        - Operational\n        - Not operational\n        - Defective\n        - Testing\n    2.  Date/times applicable for each status\n4. Sensor maintenance:\n    1.  Scheduled maintenance\n    2. Actual maintenance\n    3. Result\n    4. Replacement of consumables\n5. Sensor uncertainty:\n    1. System performance statistics claimed by manufacturer\n    2.  Sensor calibration results\n    3.  Observed sensor performance characteristics\n6. Sensor siting details:\n    1. Instrument height above ground\n    2. Station exposure description\n    3.  As discussed in the Location component (4.3.1.5), recording the location of each sensor is required.\n7. Recommended sensor settings for optimal operations on site\n8. Details of what meteorological variable is being observed by the sensor (i.e. the observed property), including:\n    1. Phenomena observed\n    2. Frequency of measurement\n    3. Frequency of acquisition\n    4.  Units of measurement\n    5.  Precision of measurement",
