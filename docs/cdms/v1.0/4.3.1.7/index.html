    2.  Sensor calibration results
    3.  Observed sensor performance characteristics
6. Sensor siting details:
    1. Instrument height above ground
    2. Station exposure description
    3.  As discussed in the Location component (4.3.1.5), recording the location of each sensor is required.
7. Recommended sensor settings for optimal operations on site
8. Details of what meteorological variable is being observed by the sensor (i.e. the observed property), including:
    1. Phenomena observed
    2. Frequency of measurement
    3. Frequency of acquisition
    4.  Units of measurement
