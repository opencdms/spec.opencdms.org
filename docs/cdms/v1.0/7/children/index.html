                    <p>This component represents the technology, software, processes and governance processes that support an effective and dynamic analysis of climate data within a web environment to facilitate understanding of climate matters and communicate issues relating to climate data. This dynamic analysis includes:
1. Geographical Information System (GIS) functionality, including the ability to perform spatial overlay analysis such as selecting points in a polygon.
2. The ability to search features by attribute, for example:
    1. Conducting a search of all stations within the catchment of a specific river.
    2. Filtering the resultant stations to view only those that observe precipitation.
    3. Viewing summary observations data for each of those stations.</p>
<p>This component integrates into a map-based interface a wide range of time-series data including climate observations, climate grids, satellite imagery and topography, together with appropriate textual and other attribute data, such as climate metadata.</p>
<p>It also facilitates dynamic data exploration and analysis using a broad array of integrated media, including maps, charts, graphs, tables and written reports.</p>

<p>The search results will contain observations data and observations metadata.</p>
<p>Some examples are:
1. Determining what observations data are available based on a set of parameters and viewing the results in a table. These parameters may include:
    1. Station
    2. Sensor or procedure
    3.  Phenomena
    4.  Data quality (based on quality flags, the climate observation quality classification or other method)
    5.  Time period
    6.  A variety of other observation metadata parameters
2. Reviewing observations metadata for selected stations.
3. Determining what datasets provide the actual observations data for a given station, sensor and phenomenon combination, together with the URL of the relevant discovery metadata records. The discovery metadata records will in turn provide the URLs of any services providing dynamic access to the data. An example could involve searching for stations that use both a tipping bucket raingauge and manual methods to observe rainfall.</p>
