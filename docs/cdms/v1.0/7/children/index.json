For example:\n1. Reliance on proprietary solutions provided by a single vendor could result in a situation known as vendor lock-in. As time passes, more and more components are developed based on the single solution. It can be very difficult and costly for a NMHS to move to a new CDMS-related solution if the current vendor\u2019s product becomes unaffordable or if the vendor goes out of business, decides that it is no longer in its interest to offer CDMS components, ceases to maintain its systems or no longer offers a competitive CDMS solution.\n2. Similarly, uncontrolled bespoke development of CDMS components by NMHS staff or contractors can also be a problem. This may result in a wide variety of disparate CDMS components that cannot be easily integrated. Many different types of technology could be used, resulting in high maintenance costs. Key-person dependencies could also develop, leaving the NMHS with a significant and costly issue to resolve, particularly if the key person leaves the organization and the CDMS ceases to operate.\n3. CDMS component solutions could be developed that do not effectively use NMHS climate data, for example:\n    1. Data may be replicated from the climate database and made into stand-alone files to support a particular technology or due to the developer\u2019s lack of experience. Whereas the data in the climate database are subject to a lengthy quality assurance lifecycle and may change, the replicated data are fixed at a point in time and may not be updated to reflect later changes to the climate record. This may become a significant issue for the NMHS, particularly if this practice is systematically applied by many developers, across many applications and over many years.\n    2. The data extraction process may not take into account quality assurance flags and just present raw observations with no indication of data quality or reliability.\n    3. Developers may not understand the complexities of the climate database data model and extract incorrect data.\n    4. Components may have any number of data inconsistency or misuse issues. What is the impact on the reputation of the NMHS if the same data are presented with differing values by different CDMS components?\n\nThere may also be architectural considerations that are better off understood early in the CDMS development so that governance processes can ensure that the considerations are implemented within developed and/or implemented software.\n\nOne issue to consider is whether the CDMS should be able to work in multiple languages. The answer to this will have implications for the design of software for the user interface of CDMS components, as well as for the generation and presentation of data products.\n\nIT architecture is a specialized field of information technology that is typically undertaken by highly experienced professionals with very broad IT experience.

They are used to support a range of activities that allow climate professionals to understand the fitness for purpose of specific data and, in many cases, improve the quality of climate observations data. This type of metadata is referred to as observations metadata in this publication.\n\nIt is anticipated that application schemas (also known as logical data models) will be developed to formally define the structure and content of the information required to describe climate observing stations, sensors and platforms (see the Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2))\n\nNote: As a general rule, it will be necessary to record and maintain the details of any change to observations metadata in order to understand the context surrounding specific climate data and to support future data homogenization activities. In addition to details of the change, specific reference must be made to:\n1. The date/time of the change - Note: It may not always be possible to define the exact date of the change, for example when a change happens between two site visits. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to include a period of time during which the change occurred.\n2. The reason the change was made.\n3. The beginning and end dates of the prior value.\n4. Any date/time reference will need to be constrained by the appropriate temporal datum to ensure that date handling is consistently applied.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) *Guide to Climatological Practices* (WMO-No. 100)\nb) *Guide to Meteorological Instruments and Methods of Observation* (WMO-No. 8)\nc) *Guide to the Global Observing System* (WMO-No. 488), Appendix III.3 Automatic weather station metadata\nd) *Manual on the Global Observing System* (WMO-No. 544), Volume I, Attachment III.1 Standard set of metadata elements for automatic weather station installations\ne) Discussion paper on stations metadata and the WMO Core Profile (Bannerman, 2012)\nf) Draft paper on the climatological needs for minimum stations metadata in the frame of WMO publication No. 9, Volume A (Stuber, 2012)\ng) Guidelines on Climate Metadata and Homogenization (WMO-No. 1186), WCDMP-53",

The need for this new type of climate metadata has become more evident following a number of attacks on the credibility of climate data. One notable example is the so-called Climategate\nincident and subsequent inquiries.\n\nTherefore, it is important for NMHSs to establish the reliability of their climate data and processes and to ensure that these data are subsequently seen as the authoritative source that can be used for global climate studies.\n\nWhile the concept of data provenance has been relatively nebulous within the information management domain for many years, there has been a significant amount of work on the concept within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for over more than a decade, particularly with regard to the development of the PROV standard.\n\nThe W3C defines provenance as:\n> [A] record that describes the people, institutions, entities, and activities involved in producing,\n> influencing, or delivering a piece of data or a thing. In particular, the provenance of information\n> is crucial in deciding whether information is to be trusted, how it should be integrated with\n> other diverse information sources, and how to give credit to its originators when reusing it. In\n> an open and inclusive environment such as the Web, where users find information that is often\n> contradictory or questionable, provenance can help those users to make trust judgements.\n> (W3C, 2013a)\n\nWhile this work is still relatively new, it is showing significant potential for use within the climate domain.\n\nThe concepts presented here for climate data provenance are quite embryonic and need further work to ensure that they can be implemented effectively. See the related recommendation in Chapter 11.\n\nMaintaining a dataset with high levels of data provenance metadata is expected to be quite expensive and, as a result, will be limited to data of high importance such as high-quality climate monitoring datasets. It is anticipated that guidance will be required to suggest what data should be maintained with what level of data provenance metadata. This guidance could perhaps be included as a policy within a future climate data framework.\n\nFor more information, see:\na) Overview of the PROV family of documents (W3C, 2013b)\nb) PROV data model specification (W3C, 2013a)",

These types of services underpin global attempts at making data easily accessible through initiatives such as the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS) (see GEOSS web page). The WMO Information System can be considered as a component of GEOSS.\n\nOpen spatial standards are being increasingly supported by a wide range of off-the-shelf software, including traditional desktop GIS software, making it easier for users to access data that are served via such services.\n\nThis is particularly important for CDMSs, as there is a large potential user base that does not routinely use climate data but could benefit from having a reliable source from which to take the data to ensure consistent use across industry. Some examples of growing interest in climate data can be found in sectors such as agriculture, emergency services, aquaculture, fishing, tourism, transportation, health and environment. Such industries typically do not understand WMO data formats such as BUFR or GRIB, nor do they understand how to exploit data delivered in such formats.\n\nWhile developing countries may not have reliable access to the Internet to take advantage of external open spatial services, it would certainly be possible to use them within their own internal local area networks, particularly as a means to visualize their data.\n\nIn short, open spatial standards are expected to become an increasingly important mechanism for distributing data in future years.\n\nNote: The open spatial components presented below are indicative of the types of standards and services that are available and appropriate for the delivery of climate data. These components are not intended to be exhaustive as there are many more services and standards that are also relevant. It is anticipated that this will be expanded upon in future revisions of this publication.\n\nFor more information, see:\n1.

The Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2) outlines the use of application schemas specifically developed for the climate domain.\n\nThese abstract representations of information provide the basis for deriving concrete encodings or data formats that allow the information to be serialized for exchange between systems and organizations.\n\nWork is proceeding within WMO to harmonize existing TDCFs (FM 92 GRIB Edition 2 and FM 94 BUFR Edition 4) with WMO METCE (described in the METCE component (4.2.3.1)), with the intent to bind those existing data formats to explicit, well-understood semantics.\n\nIn addition, the application schema can be used to develop XML-based data encodings using widely supported open standards for geographic information. The ISO 19136:2007 Geographic information \u2013 Geography Markup Language (GML) standard provides rules for serializing the abstract data model expressed as an application schema via XML encoding to create a GML\napplication schema.\n\nIn summary:\n1. An application schema can be thought of as a logical data model. For more information, see the subsection on WMO logical data models (4.2.3).\n2. A GML application schema is a physical model that is derived from a logical data model published using a particular technology - which in this case is GML. For an example, see the Combined climate observations and metadata component (8.1.2.1) below.\n\nDeriving a GML application schema from an application schema developed specifically for the climate domain (see Climate observations application schema component (4.2.3.2)) is anticipated to make climate data far more readily consumable for a broader community of users such as those interested in determining the impacts of climate change.\n\nWhile work has been conducted for several years, this task is still in its early stages as at December 2013. It is expected to take a number of years to complete. For an overview of how a logical data model (and associated application schema) could be used\nwith climate data, see Bannerman (2012), pp. 20\u201326.\n\nFor a more detailed description of what has been done to date, see Tandy (2013a), which provides an overview of the direction that WMO logical data model work is taking with regard to METCE.",
